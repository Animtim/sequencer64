RtMidi implementation issues to work out:

    -   Support for -A and -J (and skip JACK setup tries if -A is specified)
    -   Support for the --buss option
    -   Support for passing along the BPM and PPQN
        -   At startup time
        -   When changed in the GUI
    -   Issues with reading or saving the "rc" and "usr" files.
    -   The PortMidi implementation does not show
        "[0] this port".  It just shows "this port".
    -   Currently we have to do a --full-clean and then configure
        for the particular app version, otherwise weird unsolvable unresolved
        externals occur.
