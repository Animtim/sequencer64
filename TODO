Debian packaging:

    *   Need a Sequencer64-debian project to hold packages for convenience.
    -   Update documentation for the build processes.

Rtmidi implementation issues to work out:

    -   Support for passing along the BPM and PPQN
        -   At startup time
        -   When changed in the GUI
    -   Add Windows implementation and build files.
    -   Remove PortMidi implementation after Windows implementation.
    -   Make the STRIP_MUTES option permanent.

Puzzles:

    -   The Shift Key processing of Seq64 is different from Seq24.  For
        example, implementing Mod Replace with "{" (Shift-[) in Seq24
        basically works, but in Seq64 it unmutes all other patterns!
        Using a non-shift character seems to work in both, though in Seq64 the
        repeat-key rate seems to show up as an mildly annoying jitter.
    -   Toggle JACK keys does nothing.
    -   Need to disable ALSA button on playback as well, and document it
        in sequencer64-doc.
    -   No song, press Space to start.  The buttons disable.  Press space
        again, and the buttons enable, though app is still playing (the pill
        is moving.).

Tests:

    -   Test the assertion that queuing also works for "groups".
    -   Test how seq24 handles screen-sets and playback; does it restrict
        playing to the current screen-set only?

Active GitHub Issues:

    See the "FixLog" file.

Upgrades:

    -o, --options:

        We want to support app-specific options:

        seq64cli:

            -   daemonize.  Need to figure out when to daemonize, and
                to what value the current working directory should be
                set [e.g. rc().last_used_dir], or do we need another
                directory option value?
            -   file list ?

        seq64rtmidi:

            -   no GUI (daemonize)? :-D
