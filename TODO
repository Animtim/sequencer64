Debian packaging:

    *   Need a Sequencer64-debian project to hold packages for convenience.
    -   Update documentation for the build processes.

Rtmidi implementation issues to work out:

    -   Support for passing along the BPM and PPQN
        -   At startup time
        -   When changed in the GUI
    -   Add Windows implementation and build files.
    -   Remove PortMidi implementation after Windows implementation.
    -   Make the STRIP_MUTES option permanent.

Hot ideas (from GitHub):
    
    -   Mute button should be inactive unless there are armed sequences.  The
        name is a bit misleading.  Maybe it should toggle them all on if none
        are armed.
    -   Separate tempo for each pattern
    -   Tempo track
    -   Larger number of visible sets.
    -   Any way to make playback multicore?  The "stress" file maxes out a
        core.
    -   Can we use page-up/down in mainwid to change the set?  DONE!!!
    -   Issue: With sets=8x12, the stress MIDI file will crash at load or
        exit, with bad sequence #108 (out of 128 loaded).
    -   Display sequence number in sequence and event editors.

Puzzles:

    -   Need to catch up the man pages with the --help option!!!
    -   Tooltips are too flicker with unclutter enabled.
    -   When reading the "stress" file, we get this message: "Near offset
        0x16aca9: 'End-of-file', further MIDI reading disabled".
    -   In multi-wid indep mode, when set 1 (second set) is showing in slots 1
        and 2, clicking on pattern-slot 0 (pattern 32) in slot 1 toggles only
        the pattern in pattern slot 0, but clicking on the same pattern-slot
        is the second mainwid slot properly toggles both.  Actually, the rule
        is that only the one clicked, and the top-right one, toggle.  The
        reason this happens is that sequence::is_dirty_main() turns off the
        flag after the call, so only the current and first sets see the dirty
        status (how does the first see it, though?)
    -   The Shift Key processing of Seq64 is different from Seq24.  For
        example, implementing Mod Replace with "{" (Shift-[) in Seq24
        basically works, but in Seq64 it unmutes all other patterns!
        Using a non-shift character seems to work in both, though in Seq64 the
        repeat-key rate seems to show up as an mildly annoying jitter.
    -   Toggle JACK keys does nothing.
    -   Need to disable ALSA button on playback as well, and document it
        in sequencer64-doc.
    -   No song, press Space to start.  The buttons disable.  Press space
        again, and the buttons enable, though app is still playing (the pill
        is moving.).

Tests:

    -   Test the assertion that queuing also works for "groups".
    -   Test how seq24 handles screen-sets and playback; does it restrict
        playing to the current screen-set only?

Active GitHub Issues:

    See the "FixLog" file.

Upgrades:

    -o, --options:

        We want to support app-specific options:

        seq64cli:

            -   daemonize.  Need to figure out when to daemonize, and
                to what value the current working directory should be
                set [e.g. rc().last_used_dir], or do we need another
                directory option value?
            -   file list ?

        seq64rtmidi:

            -   no GUI (daemonize)? :-D

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
