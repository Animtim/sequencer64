Sequencer64 Roadmap
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-09-10 to 2017-12-31

Latest version: 0.94.1

This roadmap is a bit old.  Lots of good suggestions have come in from users,
and we have tended to give them what they want.  :-)

The starting point for the Sequencer64 project is version 0.9.2 of Seq24 from
Debian.  The initial work for this Seq24 reboot started in late July of 2015,
when I was laid up for awhile, and had basically finished documenting the
Yoshimi software synthesizer.

Also see the contrib/notes/bugs-to-investigate.txt file; I keep that one
a lot more up-to-date.  This ROADMAP is of "historical" signficance.  Also see
the TODO file, which is even "hotter".

The following changes are planned, while accomplished changes can be found in
the change-log and README files.

A 'y' marker means the work is in progress, 'x' means it is basically done.

Note that there is a LOT OF WORK to do that is listed in the
contrib/bugs-to-investigate.txt file!  And some unexpected new features have
been added along the way, thanks to user requests.

   -  User-Interface:
      x  Separate the GUI functionality from setting and operational
         classes.
      -  Upgrade the GUI to Gtk3 or Qt5.
      x  Add support for native JACK MIDI.
      -  Provide a sequencer engine that can be driven by, for example
         OSC.
      y  Add scripting support or command-line access to playback.
      y  Provide a no-GUI running mode for Sequencer64, for usage with
         tight hardware like the Raspberry Pi, and for keystroke and MIDI
         control only (no GUI controls).
   y  Unit test each element as appropriate using xpccutxx library.
   y  Add some base classes and additional member functions for common
      functionality:
      -  Offload perform "statistics" functionality to a perfstats class.
      -  Offload perform "mute groups" functionality to a perfmutes class.
      -  Handle Windows vs. Linux code more cleanly.
         -  Windows/Linux mastermidibus bases class
         -  Windows/Linux midibus bases class
   y  Enhance documentation and recreate it.
   -  Branch off to an "Enhancements" branch (highly provisional).  This will
      not be done until we have solidified Sequencer64 at version 1.0.
      For version 2.0:
      -  Convert to gtkmm-3 (maybe).
      -  Add optional build using Qt 5.
      -  Flesh out the support for PortMidi.  Nope, deprecated.
      -  Support MingW builds in Windows a la the Subatomic Glue port.
   y  Fix the JACK support.  Mostly done, but there are a number of legacy
      issues to deal with.
   y  An option to override the proprietary section with data from a file.
