# Sequencer64 0.96.0 (and above) playlist file
#
# Written on 2018-08-31 09:33:47
#
# This file holds a playlist for Sequencer64. It consists of one
# or more '[playlist]' sections.  Each section has a user-specified
# number.  This number should range from 0 to 127, but it can go
# higher if the user doesn't need to use MIDI control to select
# a playlist.
#
# Next comes a display name for this list, with or without quotes.
#
# Next comes the name of the directory, always using the UNIX-style
# separator, a forward slash (solidus).  It can optionally be
# terminated with a slash.
#
# Last comes the list of MIDI files.  They will be numbered in the
# order shown, starting from 0.  They can be simple 'base.ext'
# file-names; the playlist directory will be prepended before the
# song is accessed.
#
# If the MIDI file-name already has a directory name, that will be
# used instead.
#
# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.
