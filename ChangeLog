   * *.*: Added --ppqn option for override of the 192 setting, for testing.
   Feature still not finished.  Added a new set of pixmap font files, using
   a bold anti-aliased font for better readability.  To change back to the
   default PC font requires undefining SEQ64_USE_NEW_FONT in the font.cpp
   module.  See the new screenshot in the root directory.  Merged testing
   into master.
