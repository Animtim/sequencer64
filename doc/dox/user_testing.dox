\section user_testing_intro Introduction

This section describes user testing of Sequencer64 using Yoshimi.
It will expand as we work our way through all the many use-cases
that can be achieved with Sequencer64 and Yoshimi.

\section user_testing_smoke Smoke Test

Every so often we run Sequencer64 with a software synthesizer to make sure we
haven't broken any functionality via our major refactoring efforts.  We call it
a "smoke test".  We fire up the two application, and see if anything smokes.

This smoke test sets up Yoshimi with a very simple ALSA setup, and no
instruments are loaded.  Instead, only the "Simple Sound" is used on all
channels.  We've been doing this test with Yoshimi 1.3.6.  The current Debian
Sid ("testing") version of Yoshimi is 1.3.6-2, pulled from SourceForge.  It
seems to have issues, so we've been cloning and pulling the code from:

\verbatim
   https://github.com/Yoshimi/yoshimi.git
\endverbatim

After getting the application build and installed, the next step is to run
it, using ALSA for MIDI and for audio:

\verbatim
   $ yoshimi -a -A &
\endverbatim

Next, fix up the configuration files for Sequencer64,
<code>~/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.rc</code> and
<code>~/.config/sequencer64/sequencer64.usr</code>.

First hide <code>sequencer64.usr</code> somewhere, or delete it,
as it will determine what MIDI devices are available, and we don't want that
(yet).  Second, make sure that <code>sequencer64.rc</code> makes the following
setting:

\verbatim
   [manual-alsa-ports]

   # Set to 1 if you want seq24 to create its own ALSA ports and
   # not connect to other clients

   0   # number of manual ALSA ports
\endverbatim

Next, run the newly-built version of Sequencer64.  If desired, use the --bus
option described below to force the buss number to the buss you need, as shown
in the second version of the command:

\verbatim
   $ sequencer64/sequencer64 &
   $ sequencer64/sequencer64 --bus 5 &
\endverbatim

In <i>File / Options / MIDI Clock</i>, observe the MIDI inputs made available
by your system.  Our system shows:

\verbatim
   [0] 14:0 (Midi Through Port-0)
   [1] 128:0 (TiMidity port 0)
   [2] 128:0 (TiMidity port 1)
   [3] 128:0 (TiMidity port 2)
   [4] 128:0 (TiMidity port 3)
   [5] 129:0 (input)
\endverbatim

For some reason (a bug in Yoshimi?),
input "[5]" doesn't indicate that it is Yoshimi, but
it is.  Take note of that input number... that is the MIDI buss number that is
needed to drive Yoshimi.

Also make sure that of the clock settings for those busses are "Off".

<b>
The next instruction still works, but it is easier to simply pass the
option <code>--bus 5</code> to Sequencer64 when starting it up.
</b>

Now open the file <code>sequencer64/contrib/midi/b4uacuse-GM-format.midi</code>
in Sequencer64.  For all of the patterns (slots) that have lots of data in
them, right click on the pattern and select <i>Midi Bus / [5] 129:0 (input)</i>
and the desired channel number.  (Doesn't matter much, just use up the lower
channel numbers first).

Back in Yoshimi, select each Part corresponding to the channels you selected.
Make sure <i>Enabled</i> is checked for each desired channel.

Back in Sequencer64, click on each pattern you want to hear, which highlights
them in black.  Now click the play button (green triangle).  The song should
play, with each part using the "Simple Sound".  Not too bad for a bunch of sine
waves, eh?

Now we can test the application more fully.
Note that the instructions here are very light.
Detailed instructions on the usage of Sequencer64 can be found in the
following project, which contains a PDF file and the LaTeX code used to build
it:

\verbatim
   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer24-doc.git
\endverbatim

Although it applies to an earlier version of the project, it still mostly holds
true for Sequencer64. 

\section user_testing_patterns Tests in the Patterns Window

The Patterns window is the inside portion of the main window, supported by the
<code> mainwid </code> class.  it contains a grid of boxes or slots, with each
slot potentially containing a pattern, sequence, or track.  Empty tracks (i.e.
tracks that contain no events, like title-only tracks) are highlighted in
yellow.

This window supports only a single variant of mouse-handling.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_buttons Button Clicks on a Pattern

A left-click on a pattern slot should cause the following to happen:

   -# The pattern will be highlighted (white on a black background).
      This won't occur until the button is released.
   -# During playback, the pattern will emit MIDI events and play its sequence.
   -# If the pattern is dragged to another slot, whether playing is in progress
      or not, releasing the button in the destination slot will move the
      pattern to that slot.

A right-click on a pattern slot should cause the following to happen:

   -# If the pattern is empty, then a pop-up menu to make a New pattern, paste
      a pattern, or make other selections will appear.
   -# If the pattern is active, then a pop-up menu to Edit the pattern or make
      other selections will appear.
   -# A second right-click, just off the menu, will dismiss the menu.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_shortcuts Patterns Window Key Shortcuts

First, note the selection of the File / Options / Keyboard / Show keys option.
The tests here should work whether or not it is selected.  The only difference
is if the keys are shown.

We got a segfault during this test, when we weren't being systematic about it.

\subsection user_testing_patterns_usr The Sequencer64 User File



\section user_testing_valgrind Tests Using Valgrind

Valgrind is a very useful tool for unearthing memory issues and other issues in
an application, especially when one has the source code and can build the code
with debugging information.

\subsection user_testing_valgrind_supp Valgrind Suppressions

One problem with valgrind is that it also uncovers errors in system libraries
that one has no control over.  These errors clutter the output, so we suppress
them using a valgrind "suppressions" file.  Here's how to create one:

\verbatim
  $ valgrind --gen-suppressions=yes  ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
\endverbatim

As the program runs, one is asked to print a suppression.  If the error is due
to a system or third-party library, answer "Y return", and then copy-and-paste
the suppression to a file, giving it a name.  For example, we provide a file
<code>contrib/seq64.supp</code> containing suppressions of errors that annoy
us.

Running valgrind like this then shows only the errors we care about:

\verbatim
  $ valgrind --suppressions=contrib/seq64.supp  ./Sequencer64/sequencer64
\endverbatim

\subsection user_testing_valgrind_full Full Valgrind Leak-Checking

Here's how to capture errors, while suppressing the system errors and while
generating a log file:

\verbatim
   $valgrind --suppressions=contrib/seq64.supp --leak-check=full \
      --track-origins=yes --log-file=valgrind.log \
      ./sequencer64/sequencer64 --ppqn 384
\endverbatim

The errors can be also be re-routed to a log-file via the
"2> valgrind.log" shell redirection.
