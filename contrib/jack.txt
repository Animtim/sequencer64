Also be sure to read through the source code, especially the jack_assistant
module.  The following is a note about seq24:

   https://community.ardour.org/node/3165

    Ardour-Setup:

    * Positional Sync Source = JACK
    * Time Master = ON/Green

    seq24-Setup:

    * File -> Options -> Jack Sync
    * checked Jack Transport & Song Mode, then hit CONNECT and then OK

    By doing that i "enslaved" seq24 with Ardour, and can control it via
    Ardour-Transport-Buttons ;)

    . . .

    What I had to do is set seq24's options like this:

    Enable Jack Transport
    Enable Transport Master
    Enable Master Conditional
    Enable Song Mode

    Then hit connect after firing and setting up ardour the way you did
    above.

    Master Conditional will make it be Master only if no other JACK
    Transport application is running at the moment. For me that worked well,
    used to be offbeat also.

However, for Sequencer64, only one of the three needs to be set

    Enable Jack Transport (selects slave mode)
    Enable Transport Master
    Enable Master Conditional

We still have some work to do to improve our JACK handling.
