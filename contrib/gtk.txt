Notes for Factoring Out Gtk+

Keys:

    The first factoring out is already done:  pulling Gtk/Gdk keystroke
    support out of the perform class and providing that class with a
    keys_perform-derived reference for actually manipulating the keys used
    to control the performance.  This was a fairly easy refactoring, and
    mainly provides access to the Gtk+ keys symbols.

Quit:

    <gtkmm/main.h>

    In jack_assistant, the JackSessionSaveAndQuit session-event causes
    Gtk::Main::quit() to be called.  Gtk::Main is a static instance, and
    quit() is a static void function to exit the application.

Connect:

    <gtkmm/main.h>

    In jack_assistant, there is a call to 

    Glib::signal_idle().connect
    (
        sigc::mem_fun(*p, &jack_assistant::session_event)
    )

    The signature is "bool session_event ()".
