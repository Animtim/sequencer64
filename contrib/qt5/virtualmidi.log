# This is a sample log generated from Windows 10 while trying to
# get some kind of output.  Windows 10 is weird... the word from Google
# is that that the Microsoft MIDI Mapper disappeared from Windows after
# Windows XP.  And it is not showing as per the following link:
#
# https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/84817/using-the-midi-mapper
#
# But there it is in the output below!
#
# Device 1 was the Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth, until we installed Coolsoft's
# virtual MIDI synth:
#
# https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth
#
# which took over that spot, shoving the Wavetable Synth to the number 2 spot.
# And the virtual synth's configuration allowed us to redirect Windows Media
# Player output to either device.  But we still get the errors noted below.
