This file provides some notes on Sequencer64 and Windows.  We're mostly using
Windows 10; some features might differ in Windows 7 or Windows 2012+ Server.

Configuration Files:

    On Linux, the normal directory location of the Sequencer64 configuration
    files is "/home/username/.config/sequencer64".  Various confignames:

        sequencer64.rc
        qseq64.rc
        qplseq64.rc

    On Windows, the convention location is different, and the location used is 
    "C:\Users\username\AppData\local\sequencer64".  The configname:

        qplseq64.rc

-   What is "git rev-parse"?
-   qplseq64.rc: [midi-input] has 0 for "number of input MIDI busses".
    Might not be a bug, since nothing is plugged into the Windows VM.
    [midi-clock] shows:

    2    # number of MIDI clocks/busses

    # Output buss name: [0] 0:0 PortMidi:Microsoft MIDI Mapper
    0 0  # buss number, clock status

    # Output buss name: [1] 1:1 PortMidi:Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth (virtual)
    1 0  # buss number, clock status
