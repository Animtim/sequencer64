Notes on Windows

This file provides some notes on Sequencer64 and Windows.  We mostly use
Windows 10; some features might differ in Windows 7 or Windows 2012+ Server.

Configuration Files:

    On Linux, the normal directory location of the Sequencer64 configuration
    files is "/home/username/.config/sequencer64".  Various confignames:

        sequencer64.rc
        seq64portmidi.rc
        qseq64.rc
        qplseq64.rc

    On Windows, the conventional location is different, and the location used
    is "C:\Users\username\AppData\local\sequencer64".  The configname:

        qplseq64.rc

    To access AppData, highlight the username directory, then append
    "AppData" to the end of "C:\username".  It is a Windows thang.

    After a build, one can change to the shadow-build directory
    and run
    
        Seq64qt5\release\qplseq64.exe
        
    If it does not come up after a few seconds (Windows is *slow*), then
    run

        windeployqt Seq64qt5\release

    and try again.  Immedidately quit the application, go to your
    AppData directory and verify the presence of:

        qplseq64.rc
        qplseq64.usr

    Now plug in a MIDI device, and do the same exercise.  Open
    qplseq64.rc and see what is in it:

    [midi-clock]

    2    # number of MIDI clocks/busses

    # Output buss name: [0] 0:0 PortMidi:Microsoft MIDI Mapper
    0 0  # buss number, clock status

    # Output buss name: [2] 1:1 PortMidi:Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth (virtual)
    1 0  # buss number, clock status

    # Output buss name: [3] 1:1 PortMidi:nanoKEY2
    2 0  # buss number, clock status
    

    [midi-input]
    
    1    # number of input MIDI busses

	# The first number is the port number, and the second number
	# indicates whether it is disabled (0), or enabled (1).

	# [1] 0:1 PortMidi:nanoKEY2
	0 0

	As of this time (2018-04-15) these settings are the only way to
	alter the ports accessed, in the Windows version of Sequencer64.

	qplseq64 --buss 1 --option log=filename.out
