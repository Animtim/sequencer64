This directory contains contributed WRK (older-style Cakewalk)
files for examples and testing.

   longhair.wrk:

        A tune we had transcribed, useful for testing the timing of the
        PortMidi, ALSA, and JACK implementations.  This transcription 
        was initially done via the Atari ST program "EditTrack".  Later,
        it was converted via Cakewalk for DOS.

   oxygene4b.wrk:

        A fortuitous discovery, our by-ear transcription of this
        Jean-Michel Jarre tune stores the notes in a Note Array, unlike
        "longhair.wrk".  Thus, it provides an additional test of the
        import of WRK files.
