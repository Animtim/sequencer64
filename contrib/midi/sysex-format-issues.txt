What Is Up With the SysEx Format?

Conflicting information from around the web.  We have encounter at least two
different formats claimed for the SysEx MIDI message.

Sysex:

   F0 varinumlen databytes F7

      varinumlen counts the databytes and F7

   F0 manufacturer-ID-byte ... F7

The midicvt seems to follow the first format, except that it calls the F7
a "continuation byte"!

Another form of sysex event is provided which does not imply that an F0 should
be transmitted. This may be used as an "escape" to provide for the transmission
of things which would not otherwise be legal, including system realtime
messages, song pointer or select, MIDI Time Code, etc. This uses the F7 code:

F7 <length> <all bytes to be transmitted>

Here is a MIDI File of a multi-packet system exclusive message: suppose the
bytes F0 43 12 00 were to be sent, followed by a 200-tick delay, followed by
the bytes 43 12 00 43 12 00, followed by a 100-tick delay, followed by the
bytes 43 12 00 F7, this would be in the MIDI File:

F0 03 43 12 00
81 48                      200-tick delta time
F7 06 43 12 00 43 12 00
64                         100-tick delta time
F7 04 43 12 00 F7

The 0xF7 Status byte is dedicated to marking the end of a SysEx message. It
should never occur without a preceding 0xF0 Status. In the event that a device
experiences such a condition (ie, maybe the MIDI cable was connected during the
transmission of a SysEx message), the device should ignore the 0xF7.

Furthermore, although the 0xF7 is supposed to mark the end of a SysEx message,
in fact, any status (except for Realtime Category messages) will cause a SysEx
message to be considered "done" (ie, actually "aborted" is a better description
since such a scenario indicates an abnormal MIDI condition). For example, if a
0x90 happened to be sent sometime after a 0xF0 (but before the 0xF7), then the
SysEx message would be considered aborted at that point. It should be noted
that, like all System Common messages, SysEx cancels any current running
status. In other words, the next Voice Category message (after the SysEx
message) must begin with a Status.

http://www.blitter.com/~russtopia/MIDI/~jglatt/tech/midifile/evts.htm:

SYSEX (system exclusive) events (status = F0) are a special case because a
SYSEX event can be any length. After the F0 status (which is always stored
-- no running status here), you will find yet another series of variable
length bytes. Combine them with ReadVarLen() and you will come up with a
32-bit value that tells you how many more bytes follow which make up this
SYSEX event. This length does not include the F0 status.

For example, consider the following SYSEX MIDI message:

F0 7F 7F 04 01 7F 7F F7

This would be stored in a MIDI file as the following series of bytes
(minus the delta-time bytes which would precede it):

F0 07 7F 7F 04 01 7F 7F F7

The 07 above is the variable length quantity (which happens to fit in just
one byte for this example). It indicates that there are seven, following
bytes that comprise this SYSEX message.

Really oddball midi units send a system exclusive message as a series of
small "packets" (with a time delay inbetween transmission of each packet).
The first packet begins with an F0, but it does not end with an F7. The
subsequent packets do not start with an F0 nor end with F7. The last
packet does not start with an F0, but does end with the F7. So, between
the first packets opening F0 and the last packets closing F7, there is 1
SYSEX message there. (Note: only extremely poor designs, such as the crap
marketed by Casio exhibit such horrid behavior). Of course, since a delay
is needed inbetween each packet, you need to store each packet as a
separate event with its own time in the MTrk. Also, you need some way of
knowing which events should not begin with an F0 (ie, all of them except
the first packet). So, the MIDI file redefines a midi status of F7
(normally used as an end mark for SYSEX packets) as a way to indicate an
event that does not begin with F0. If such an event follows an F0 event,
then it is assumed that the F7 event is the second "packet" of a series.

In this context, it is referred to as a SYSEX CONTINUATION event. Just
like the F0 type of event, it has a variable length followed by data
bytes. On the other hand, the F7 event could be used to store MIDI
REALTIME or MIDI COMMON messages. In this case, after the variable length
bytes, you should expect to find a MIDI Status byte of F1, F2, F3, F6, F8,
FA, FB, FC, or FE. (Note that you would not find any such bytes inside of
a SYSEX CONTINUATION event). When used in this manner, the F7 event is
referred to as an ESCAPED event.
