This directory contains contributed MIDI files for examples and testing.

   click_4_4.midi:
   
        Holds a click-track for use with the Seq24-session script.

   reset.mid:
   
        A file that resets all MIDI channels.

   b4uacuse-GM-format.midi:
   
        Hopefully, a good General MIDI file; created by Sequencer24.
