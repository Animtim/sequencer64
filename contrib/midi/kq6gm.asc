Here's a fairly long SMF MIDI file for testing.  Rather than include
this file, here is the link to the package that contains it:

midicvt has issues with the KQ6GM.MID file:

% midicvt kq6gm.mid  -o t.t
? Error at MIDI file offset 396 [0x018c]
Error: readtrack(): unexpected running status

And this is all that gets written:

Sequencer64 doesn't seem to have issues with this over 800K file, so far.
Supposedly about 2 hours of playing time!
