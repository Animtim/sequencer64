Interesting Test Files from the "midicvt" Project

While loading the test MIDI files from our "midicvt" project into Sequencer64,
we found some interesting cases.

   b4uacuse-non-mtrk.midi:
   
      This file has a "MUnk" tag marking the proprietary data track.
      Sequencer64 correctly bypasses this chunk, but perhaps there's a way to
      persist a little more to see if the rest of the chunk is well-formed
      enough to load.

   choo2xg.mid:

      This file yields "? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...", and
      loads 31 tracks, 15 of them being empty title tracks.

   CountryStrum.mid:

      This file yields a load error and a warning:

      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      unsupported MIDI format detected: 0

      We ought to see if we can import SMF 0, at least, into Sequencer64.

   dixie03.mid:

      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      unsupported MIDI format detected: 0
      unsupported MIDI format detected: 0

   Dixie04.mid:

      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      unsupported MIDI format detected: 0
      unsupported MIDI format detected: 0
      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
         .  .  .
      ? no support for SYSEX messages, skipping...
      unsupported MIDI chunk, skipping: 35000000
      Segmentation fault

      Oh goody, a potential bug to fix!!!!

      Well, first thing, we add better error reporting to the midifile and
      mainwnd modules.  Then we add a test against the MIDI file size so that
      we don't try to get data past that file size.  Once the data counter is
      too big, we disable using it.

      This leads to about 8 of the following message:

      ? Buffer overflow reading MIDI data, further reading disabled

      Followed by "Unsupported MIDI chunk, skipping:        0",
      and four more of the buffer-overflow messages... and then...
      the file is loaded!

      Some of the tracks have really short notes, like 1/64th notes or less!
      The file ends, according to midicvt, with 11 Sysex messages.
      Yet we get a "no support" message for every byte in every Sysex message,
      it seems.
