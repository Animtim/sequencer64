MIDI Files for Scales

2016-05-17 to 2016-05-18

This directory contains MIDI files for scales, to help test
the scales feature of the pattern editor.  They come from this site:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_scales_and_modes

Note that the Aeolean mode is the natural minor scale, and the Ionian mode
is the major scale.

All events are on channel 0. The file starts with a Program Change to 0
(i.e. the Piano).  Then 5 MIDI CC (Control Change or Continuous
Controllers) values are presented:

    121 Reset All Controllers
     64 Damper Pedal/Sustain Pedal 0 (off)
     91 Effect 1 value 48 Depth Usually controls reverb send amount.
     10 Pan value 51 (just left of center)
      7 Volume Control value 100

We will preserve this information only for the first (major) scale.

    "Off (chromatic)"
    "Major (Ionian)"
    "Minor (Aeolan)"
    "Harmonic Minor"
    "Melodic Minor"
    "Whole Tone"
    "Blues"
    "Pentatonic Major"
    "Pentatonic Minor"
