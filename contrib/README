	[Seq24-devel] [PATCH] support for jack-session API
	From: torbenh <torbenh@gm...> - 2010-03-30 14:45:13
	Attachments: jack-session.patch    

	hi...

	here is a patch for jack-session API.

	i changed jack1 behaviour regarding clients that dont have a process
	callback. the result is that seq24 sync_callback is not called anymore.

	however... seq24 is not a slow-sync client so it shouldnt have a sync
	callback anyways.
	gonna change it to a process cb.

	tell me what you think.
