# Sequencer64 0.9.13 (and above) rc configuration file
#
# This file holds the main configuration options for Sequencer64.
# It follows the format of the legacy seq24 'rc' configuration
# file, but adds some new options, such as LASH, Mod4 interaction
# support, and an auto-save-on-exit option.  Also provided is a
# legacy mode.

# The first line indicates the number of MIDI busses defined.

# Each buss line contains the buss (re 0) and the clock status of
# that buss.  0 = MIDI Clock is off; 1 = MIDI Clock on, and Song
# Position and MIDI Continue will be sent, if needed; and 2 = MIDI
# Clock Modulo, where MIDI clocking will not begin until the song
# position reaches the start modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks].

[jack-transport]

# jack_transport - Enable slave synchronization with JACK Transport.

0

# jack_master - Sequencer64 attempts to serve as JACK Master.
# Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface forces this,
# and also disables jack_master_cond).

0

# jack_master_cond - Sequencer64 is JACK master if no other JACK
# master exists. Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface
# forces this, and disables jack_master).

0

# jack_start_mode (applies only if JACK is enabled).

# 0 = Playback in live mode. Allows muting and unmuting of loops.
#     from the main (patterns) window.  Disables both manual and
#     automatic muting and unmuting from the performance window.
# 1 = Playback uses the song (performance) editor's data and mute
#     controls, regardless of which window was used to start the
#     playback.

[lash-session]

# Set the following value to 0 to disable LASH session management.
# Set the following value to 1 to enable LASH session management.
# This value will have no effect if LASH support is not built into
# the application.  Use --help option to see if LASH is part of
# the options list.

0     # LASH session management support flag

[auto-option-save]

# Set the following value to 0 to disable the automatic saving of the
# current configuration to the 'rc' and 'user' files.  Set it to 1 to
# follow legacy seq24 behavior of saving the configuration at exit.
# Note that, if auto-save is set, many of the command-line settings,
# such as the JACK/ALSA settings, are then saved to the configuration,
# which can confuse one at first.  Also note that one currently needs
# this option set to 1 to save the configuration, as there is not a
# user-interface control for it at present.
