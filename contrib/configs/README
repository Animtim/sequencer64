Sample Configuration Files

This README explains what each of these files are.

sequencer64.conf:

   This file should be copied to /etc/ld.so.conf.d, and then "installed"
   by running the ldconfig command.  All done as root, of course.
   Should be done by the installer, but saved here just in case.

sequencer64.rc.example:

   An "rc" file that somewhat hews to the default seq24 settings.

sequencer64.rc.keys:

   An "rc" file with the keys for mute-toggling and group-learning
   arrange similarly, so that the latter are the "Shift" versions of
   the former.

   When in group-learn mode, the Shift key cannot be hit, so this mode
   automatically converts the keys to their shifted versions.

sequencer64.usr.example:

   A new-format "usr" file illustrating all of the new settings that can be
   made.

TO DO:

   sequence64.rc.bad
   sequencer64-basic.rc.example
   sequencer64-basic.usr.example
   sequencer64-daniel.rc
   sequencer64-minimal.rc
   sequencer64-timidity-yoshimi.usr.example

dot-seq24rc:
seq24usr.example:

   Configuration Files in seq24 format.
