Subject: Re: [ahlstromcj/sequencer64] Seq64 launching without GUI on ARM
        (Raspberry Pi) platform (#160)

[-- Autoview using elinks -dump '/tmp/mutt.html' --]
   btw, 0.96 does not have the GUI problem. But 0.96 on arm needs this block
   in the Makefile

 .c.lo:
       $(AM_V_CC)$(LTCOMPILE) -MT $@ -MD -MP -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo -c -o $@ $<
       $(AM_V_at)$(am__mv) $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/$*.Plo

   (thanks to [1]https://stackoverflow.com/a/21642830/2819581)
   or it will moan that it's missing event_list.lo

   Thanks to the developers. I am majorly impressed by the build system!

-MD

    Similar to "-M -MF file".  Generates a dependency output file as a
    side-effect of compilation.

-MP

    Cpp will add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file,
    causing each to depend on nothing.

-MT target

    Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.
    Sets the target exactly to the specified string.
