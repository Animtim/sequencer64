Comparison of MIDI Libraries

Currently, Sequencer64 supports two forms of MIDI buss APIs:

    -   ALSA
    -   PortMidi
        -   ALSA
        -   OSX CoreMidi
        -   Windows MME

We would like to support JACK, and there seems to be at least two ways to
do it:

    -   JACK API
    -   RtMidi
        -   Linux
            -   JACK
            -   ALSA
        -   OSX
            -   JACK
            -   CoreMidi
        -   Windows MME

So we are considering leaving PortMidi alone and recreating the MIDI buss
suport using RtMidi.  Here is a feature matrix based on what is already in
use in Sequencer64.
