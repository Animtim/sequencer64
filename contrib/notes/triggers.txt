This document analyzes how triggers work.  We turn on the printing of triggers
and look at some examples.

b4uacus-GM-alternate.midi:

	sequence 'Untitled' triggers:
	sequence 'PSS-790 Patchin' triggers:
	  tick_start = 240; tick_end = 287; offset = 768; selected = false
	  tick_start = 768; tick_end = 2255; offset = 768; selected = false
	sequence 'Guitar 1 (E.C.)' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 80112; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Guitar 2 (R.C.)' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 80240; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Vocal' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 69264; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Rhythm (Chords)' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 80384; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Bass Guitar' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 79856; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Drums' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 5375; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 8448; tick_end = 80235; offset = 3072; selected = false
	sequence 'Chris Ahlstrom' triggers:
	sequence '(GEnie: KICKAHA' triggers:
	sequence '"Before You' triggers:
	sequence 'Accuse Me" by' triggers:
	sequence 'Eric Clapton &' triggers:
	sequence 'Robert Cray' triggers:

Bars.midi:

	sequence 'One Bar' triggers:
	  tick_start = 0; tick_end = 767; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 1536; tick_end = 2303; offset = 0; selected = false
	  tick_start = 3072; tick_end = 3839; offset = 0; selected = false
	sequence 'Two Bars' triggers:
	  tick_start = 1536; tick_end = 3071; offset = 0; selected = false

	After adding another 'Two Bars' segment, and extra line:

	  tick_start = 4608; tick_end = 9215; offset = 0; selected = false

    After moving the new segment rightward one quarter-note:

      tick_start = 4800; tick_end = 9407; offset = 192; selected = false

    After moving the new segment leftward two quarter-notes:

      tick_start = 4416; tick_end = 9023; offset = 1344; selected = false

TODO:

    Document that, after selecting (greying) a segment, and then going
    into Paint mode, the Left and Right arrow keys can move then segment.

    FIX the zZ keys so that they DO NOT work if Ctrl is held.  Very
    confusing!!!!

    Figure out how to keep tables (in the documentation) in their proper
    location.
