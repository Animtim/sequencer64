Considerations for building Non-DAW and adding NSM (Non Session Manager)
support into Sequencer64.

Getting and building Non-DAW, first try:

    http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.non-daw/94

	Here is what I did a few weeks ago on Ubuntu 12.04:

	Get the most up-to-date version.

	git clone -b next git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/non/daw.git
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

	Install the following:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential xutils-dev libjack-jackd2-dev
		liblo-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev libfltk1.1-dev fluid libsndfile-dev
		liblrdf-dev libxpm-dev libcairo2-dev checkinstall

	Then run:

	make -C lib
	make
	and finally
	sudo checkinstall

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
