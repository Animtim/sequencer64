Zoom in Sequencer64

This document analyzes how zoom works.  We have issues synchronizing the
seqroll, seqdata (especially), seqevent, and seqtime views.

All zoom functions are called by seqedit::set_zoom() and basically set the
class member m_zoom and then call the class reset() function.  So we trace
each reset function.

seqroll:

    reset()
    {
        get m_hadjust value and modify the x offset based on m_zoom;
        update_sizes()
        {
        }
        update_and_draw()
        {
        }
    }
