In this document we explore how queuing should work.

Keep-Queue:

    Simple use case:

        -   Start seq64 with one main window.
        -   Load the file "horse.midi".
        -   Start playback.
        -   Press (and release) the keep-queue key:

            -   Press the hot-keys 1, q, a, and z during playback, slowly
                one after the other.  Observe that each pattern is queued
                on in its turn, while previous patterns are unaffected and
                keep

            -   Press the hot-keys 1, q, a, and z again during playback,
                slowly one after the other.  Observe that each pattern is
                queued off in its turn, while previous patterns are
                unaffected and keep playing (until un-queue).

Replace/Solo:

    Simple use case:

        -   Start seq64 with one main window.
        -   Load the file "horse.midi".
        -   Start playback.
        -   Turn on some patterns (if desired).
        -   Press and hold the Replace/Solo key.

            -   Press one of the hot-keys 1, q, a, or z.  Observe that
                only that pattern will play, no matter what patterns were
                playing before.

        Need to release the Replace key, the press it again,
        before trying to solo another pattern.

Queued Replace/Solo:

    Simple use case:

        -   Start seq64 with one main window.
        -   Load the file "horse.midi".
        -   Start playback.
        -   Turn on some patterns.
        -   Press (and release) the keep-queue key.
        -   Press and hold the Replace/Solo key.

            -   Press one of the hot-keys 1, q, a, or z.  Observe that
                the pattern selected is queued up to be on, while any
                other patterns that are played are queued up to turn off.
