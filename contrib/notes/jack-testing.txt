Testing JACK in Sequencer64
Chris Ahlstrom
2016-01-16 to 2016-01-24

These tests are done with qjackctl and hydrogen already running, and then
starting Sequencer64 with certain settings already made in sequencer64.rc..
They currently show some issues.

1.  [jack_transport]    == 1
    [jack_master]       == 0
    [jack_master_cond]  == 0

    a. Do not start the JACK transport in qjackctl.
    b. Set Hydrogen to use JACK transport, but not be Master.
    c. Load a MIDI file.
    d. Start playback (Space bar) in Sequencer64, then stop it (Escape)
       after a bit.

    Actual Results:

        Hydrogen starts playing.  Qjackctl starts counting time.
        Every Space restarts both, resetting the time.  Escape stops both,
        but doesn't reset the time.  Sequencer64 does not play.

    Expected Results:

        TO DO

    e. Now start Hydrogen's playback instead.

    Actual Results:

        Hydrogen plays, but Sequencer64 does not.  Hydrogen can pause,
        which keeps the time the same when restarted.  The Stop button in
        Hydrogen will cause the time to be restarted.

2.  [jack_transport]    == 1
    [jack_master]       == 1
    [jack_master_cond]  == 0

    Either edit sequencer64.rc, or make the setting in the GUI, and click
    JACK Disconnect, and then JACK Connect.

    Actual Results:

        Similar to scenario 1, except that now Sequencer64 also plays
        back.

        Are JACK slaves allowed to start/stop playback on the JACK buss?
    
    Bug:

        The main window Stop and Start buttons behave the same, except
        that, once the focus of the user-interface is on the Stop button,
        hitting the Space bar causes a fast start-then-stop action.

    Bug? (Probably not, I saw this in the code, too):

        Sequencer64, as Master:  BPM value cannot be modified from 120
        while transport is running.  It can be altered while it is stopped,
        and will affect the speed of playback..

    Still true?:

        At exit, we also "[Cannot release JACK timebase]", probably
        shouldn't be doing that.

    Done: We think we may not want to change the transport
    position unless we are the JACK Master.  We have added
    a relocate parameter.

    True?: Why doesn't the jack transport make seq24 progress?

If we disable Jack Master in Sequencer64 and enable it in Hydrogen,
then Hydrogren controls playback, including the speed.  It then doesn't
matter what the BPM is then set to in Sequencer64.

Start Qjackctl with

qjackctl &

You can then click on the Start button to start jackd. Your linux station
is now set up to play music.

Install Zynaddsubfx, Seq24 and Hydrogen 

seq24 --manual_alsa_ports & zynaddsubfx -r 48000 -b 128 & hydrogen -d jack
&

Click on the "Connect" button of QJackctl. Check on the "Audio" tab that
Zynaddsubfx and Hydrogen outputs are connected to ALSA's PCM input.

On the ALSA tab, connect Seq24 first output to Zynaddsubfx's input, and
connect Seq24 second output to Hydrogen's input.

Select an instrument in Zynaddsubfx in the Instrument>Show Instrument Bank
menu. Then set the MIDI channel of Zynaddsubfx to 2 (It currently shows
"1"). Select another instrument for the second midi channel. Repeat the
operation for a third instrument.

Right-click in Seq24's grid and choose new. You will get a sequence
edition window. You can adjust the length of the sequence, which is by
default 1 bar. Let's tell Seq24 we want to play on the Hydrogen rhythmbox :
In the Output Bus menu left to the field that shows "[1] seq24 1" and set
it to "[2] seq24 2". Remember we connected Seq24's second midi output to
Hydrogen.

There's three MIDI buttons in the down left corner of the window. Click on
the first one to tell Seq24 to send midi events to Hydrogen. You can now
edit your pattern by holding right-mouse's button and left-clicking to
paste notes. You can adjust their length with the field next to the
sequence length. You can click on the piano keyboard to ear how each note
sounds. Hydrogen set's runs from C2 to D#3. Press "Play" to listen to your
sequence.

Once you have a Drum sequence, you can repeat theses steps to add our
three Zynaddsufx's instruments. Just select the first Output Bus for the
sequence (we connected the first seq24 output to Zynaddsubfx already). To
select one of the three Zynaddsubfx instruments, click on the button
showing a MIDI plug next to the Output Bus field and select one from 1 to
3.

Once you have some sequences, you can use them to compose the song : on
the main Seq24 windows, there's a 'Song Edition' button in the right down
corner. Click on it. In the new window, you can click the same way that in
the sequence windows to draw song sequences. Click on "Play" to play your
song.

I use this setup:

                          +---------------+
                          |    ARDOUR     |
                          |               |
Seq24 --> QSynth -----------> Audio 1     |
  |                       |               |
  +-----> ZynAddSubFx ------> Audio 2     |
  |                       |               |
  +-----> Hydrogen ---------> Audio 3     |
                          |               |
                          +---------------+

And works fine for me. As Seq24 generates all the midi events, there are 
no sync problems.
