How do Seq24 Triggers Work?

Trying to figure out triggers.  Remember that sequence and pattern, ticks
and MIDI pulses are used interchangeably.

First, we take the relatively simple file midi/signature-samples.midi,
which consists of some short sequences with various time signatures and a
one-measure length.  It also contains a performance setup where each
sequence is dragged into the performance for about four measures (not all
of them fit exactly into 4 measures).  Turning on console output
temporarily, we see that the triggers that get written to the file are:

   Trk  0: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3071, offset = 0
   Trk  1: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3455, offset = 0
   Trk  2: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3071, offset = 0
   Trk  3: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 2879, offset = 0
   Trk  4: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3167, offset = 0
   Trk  5: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3071, offset = 0
   Trk  6: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3359, offset = 0
   Trk  7: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 3071, offset = 0

End 3071 is exactly four measures, which happens to be 96 pixels, at the
default zoom of 32 pulses/pixel, or 3072 pixels, which is 768
pixels/measure.

Now let us try a more complex example, midi/b4uacuse-GM-alternate.midi:

   Trk  1: trigger  0: start = 240, end = 287, offset = 0
   Trk  1: trigger  1: start = 768, end = 2255, offset = 0
   Trk  2: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  2: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 80112, offset = 3072
   Trk  3: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  3: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 80240, offset = 3072
   Trk  4: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  4: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 69264, offset = 3072
   Trk  5: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  5: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 80384, offset = 3072
   Trk  6: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  6: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 79856, offset = 3072
   Trk  7: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 5375, offset = 0
   Trk  7: trigger  1: start = 8448, end = 80235, offset = 3072

Tracks 0, and 8 and above were not included in the performance, so they
do not appear in this list.

Let us look at the numbers for track 2, which is active from measures 1 through
7 (7 measures), inactive from measures 8 to 11 (4 measures), and finishes off
in measures 12 through 104, plus a little more (about 104.3 measures):

    Measures  1 to   7  == 0 to 5375 (5076) pulses.
    Measures  8 to  11  == 5376 to 8447 (3072) pulses.
    Measures 12 to 104+ == 8448 to 80112 (104.31 measures)

So what does the offset value mean?

We highlight the second section of track 2 (third row in the performance
editor) by left-clicking in and use the arrow key (a new feature in
Sequencer64) to move the second part rightward by one measure.  We then
see the first section is the same, and the second section is

   Trk  2: trigger  1: start = 9216, end = 80880, offset = 3840

All pulses in the second section have moved up the 768 pulses (1 measure).

Now move the second section leftward until it abuts the first section (it
will go no further).  We see:

   Trk  2: trigger  1: start = 5376, end = 77040, offset = 0

One more trial with the smaller file midi/signature-samples.midi.  Take the 7th
track ("8 / 8").  Click the 'p' key to enter paint mode (same as using
right-click plus left-click) and click in row 8 measure 7 to add a
measure.  Then click in row 8 measure 9 to add another measure.  We end up
with three sections.  Highlight the measure-9 section and move it leftward
two snaps; now it starts halfway through measure 8.  The result:

    Trk  7: trigger  1: start = 3072, end = 3839, offset = 0
    Trk  7: trigger  2: start = 4608, end = 5375, offset = 0
    Trk  7: trigger  3: start = 5760, end = 6527, offset = 384

Why is the offset of trigger 2 == 0, while the offset of trigger 3 is 384?

Hold that thought.  Reload the file, and, then left-click on the time bar
to move the left marker ("L") to the beginning of measure 2, and
right-click on the time bar to move the right marker ("R") to the end of
measure 2.  Then click middle L/R button ("Expand") to open up the space
for all tracks.  The result

    Trk  0: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  0: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3839, offset = 0
    Trk  1: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  1: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 4223, offset = 192
    Trk  2: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  2: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3839, offset = 0
    Trk  3: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  3: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3647, offset = 768
    Trk  4: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  4: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3935, offset = 192
    Trk  5: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  5: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3839, offset = 0
    Trk  6: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  6: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 4127, offset = 96
    Trk  7: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  7: trigger  1: start = 1536, end = 3839, offset = 0

Why are some of the trigger 1 offsets == 0, while others are non-zero?
The tracks that have a trigger 1 offset of zero:  

    Track 0: "1 / 2"
    Track 2: "4 / 4"
    Track 5: "4 / 8"
    Track 7: "8 / 8"

These are the 4 tracks where drawing an integral number of copies yielded
a length of exactly 4 measures, instead of something a little bit less or
greater.

Looking at an expanded view of this performance layout, one sees that
the offset looks like how far into the track the beginning of the second
section is.

Let us reload the file again and carefully set the L and R markers to
expand it by 1.5 measures instead of just one.  Now we get:

    Trk  0: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  0: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4223, offset = 0
    Trk  1: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  1: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4607, offset = 0
    Trk  2: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  2: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4223, offset = 384
    Trk  3: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  3: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4031, offset = 192
    Trk  4: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  4: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4319, offset = 0
    Trk  5: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  5: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4223, offset = 0
    Trk  6: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  6: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4511, offset = 480
    Trk  7: trigger  0: start = 0, end = 767, offset = 0
    Trk  7: trigger  1: start = 1920, end = 4223, offset = 384

We believe that the offset indicates how far into the sequence the
section has to go to place copies at the given location, and
that the offset can depend how long the track is compared to the gap.
For very long tracks, the offset is basically the size of the gap.

For short tracks, that might repeat during the duration of the gap, the
offset is also affected by repeats of the pattern, and so would oscillate
between 0 the the pattern length as the gap continuously increased, we
surmise.
