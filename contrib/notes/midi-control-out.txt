   First, kudos for a great software, it has almost everything I need! :)

   I've tried [1]@igorangst fork just now, configured it with

   ./configure --enable-midictrlout

   I'm aiming at triggering some patterns/sequences with my novation
   Launchpad Pro. I have been able to use the [midi-control] for a 8x4-grid
   and an 8x8 grid using mididings, but the [midi-control-out] resets itself
   to all zeroes [0 0 0 0 0 0] on all 0-31 fields when i quit seq64 if my
   data looks like this:

   0 [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [0 2 144 81 16] [0 0 0 0 0]
   [..]
   31 [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [0 2 144 58 16] [0 0 0 0 0]

   It had to do with me not enabling (on/off-ing) the entries. When I put a 1
   to enable the entries, they do not reset.

   To send flashing green when queued I should use a row like

   0 [0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [1 2 144 81 16] [0 0 0 0 0]

   where 2 is the MIDI-channel that is mandatory for getting the button to
   blink. However, when I quit seq64 the 2 is gone. I see that the control
   out is hardwired to MIDI-channel 15, where can I change this in the code?

   This is really the only thing left - in an otherwise great (!!) piece of
   software - that stops me from using it in a live setting. I'm happy to
   test, however I'm not a C-developer..

   Hi,
   I confirm that there is a problem with inactive entries not being saved
   and thus being reset to 0. It has been some time that I worked on this,
   and I'm really happy that there is somebody out there ready to give it a
   try with a real piece of hardware. I will try and fix this as soon as I
   can spare some time. It is quite possible that I didn't implement the
   channel, since I only use channel 1 in my hardware. As far as I remember,
   15 is the number of the (ALSA/Jack) output and does not refer to the MIDI
   channel.

   Awesome!
   I'll change the m_buss(2) parameter in libseq64/src/midi_control_out.cpp
   back to m_buss(15) then. Wingin' it a bit... :)

   If I may make a wish list it would be to have the grid on the Launchpad
   Pro reflect the grid in Sequencer64, maybe with some sort of translation
   table between the default colors in Seq64:

     * Red
     * Green
     * Yellow
     * Blue
     * Magenta
     * White
     * Dark red
     * Dark Green
     * Dark Yellow
     * Dark Blue
     * Dark Magenta
     * Dark Cyan
     * Orange
     * Dark Orange

   That would (in my mind at least) allow for e.g. setting a 3-color scheme
   for the controllers that does not have full RGB-color LEDs, just by
   adjusting the color codes. Also, I would not use the Red and Green colors
   (why, I hope will be apparent below), and may want to translate them into
   some other colors instead.

   I would also like Sequencer64 to mimick the behaviour of the Launchpad
   when used with Ableton Live (which I have never done, just seen videos).
   That means that

     * When queuing a sequence, it should be flashing green. (MIDI-Ch 2,
       NoteOn, Pad XX, Color)
     * When playing a sequence, it should be pulsing green. (MIDI-Ch 3,
       NoteOn, Pad XX, Color)
     * When arming a track to record, it should be flashing red. (MIDI-Ch 2,
       NoteOn, Pad XX, Color)
     * When recording in a sequence, it should be pulsing red. (MIDI-Ch 3,
       NoteOn, Pad XX, Color)

   Stopping these requires a send of a (MIDI-Ch 1, NoteOn, Pad XX, Color) to
   the Launchpad Pro.

   It is also possible to light several LEDs with a single SysEx-message on
   the Launchpad Pro, further detailed in the [1]programmers reference but
   that might not be a way forward for other controllers, so maybe it's best
   to stick with MIDI messages.

   Also, the pad note numbers seems to vary wildly even within the Launchpad
   family of controllers...

   I'm starting seq64 with the -j option to connect it to JACK transport and
   use JACK midi, not ALSA.

   If in Sequencer64 I open a sequence and select MIDI Output Bus "[0] 0:0
   seq64:system midi_playback_1" and MIDI channel 1, 2 or 3 and connect that
   bus/port in Qjackctl to the writable/input port "system: midi_playback_2"
   I can light up the LaunchPad Pro buttons by playing/sending MIDI notes to
   it.

   However, I can't get anything to light up using the Launchpad Pro
   triggering patterns. They queue up and start playing, but not a single
   indication on the LPPro.

   Do I have to connect some ports in JACK to get it to work, or how do I go
   about it?

   These lines in libseq64/src/perform.cpp:

 #ifdef SEQ64_MIDI_CTRL_OUT
     if (status | c_status_queue)
         m_midi_ctrl_out->send_event(midi_control_out::action_queue_on);

   and these lines of code in libseq64/src/sequence.cpp:

 #ifdef SEQ64_MIDI_CTRL_OUT
     if (m_queued)
     {
         m_parent->get_midi_control_out()->send_seq_event(number(), midi_control_out
::seq_action_queue);

   only get executed when I quit seq64, not when queueing the various
   sequences during play.

   Maybe I'm not doing something right? As I said previously, I'm just
   guessing here to try to find something that seems to have a bearing on
   what I'm trying to accomplish..

   Thanks for the feedback. By "get executed" I suppose you mean that the
   messages only make it out to the Launch Pad when you quit seq64. I guess
   this is related to the fact that the MIDI output bus needs a flush. I
   could not figure out why this is the case, it seems to depend on the
   underlying MIDI implementation. Maybe [1]@ahlstromcj knows more about
   this. Can you try the following:

   The functions send_(seq)_event have an optional boolean argument, telling
   it to flush the bus after sending. So change the code snippets to
   if (status | c_status_queue)
   m_midi_ctrl_out->send_event(midi_control_out::action_queue_on, true);
   and
   m_parent->get_midi_control_out()->send_seq_event(number(),
   midi_control_out::seq_action_queue, true);
