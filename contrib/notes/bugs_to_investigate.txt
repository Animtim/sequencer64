Bugs and Additional Upgrade Ideas
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-10-27 to 2016-02-18 (New bugs)

In no particular order...  "y" means "in progress", and "x" means it is
basically done.

-  See BUG REPORTS below.
-  Interesting.  The non-empty patch sequences in the "b4uacuse" MIDI files
   at first show progress bars that run wildly.  But, if one does a
   right-click Edit on them, then they run properly for a 4/4 one-bar pattern.
   However, if the file is saved after that, and reloaded, now the patterns
   are fine.  The differences?
   -    The new file has "TimeSig 4/4 24 8"  and "Tempo 8".
   -    Measures values of non-zero now?
   I also suspect the various seq-set functions (for beat, etc) that are
   called modify the sequence to make it work.  HOWEVER, IMPORTING a mid file
   and SAVING IT still leaves the problem.  Need to fix that without bringing
   up the sequence editor, when the file is read; if 0, set the measures to 1.
-  Make sure that Sequencer64 handles running status, via the files that
   midicvt discusses.
x  Need to clarify the behavior of JACK-Live mode versus using the controls of
   the pattern versus song window.
-  We need to be able to empty out any sequences and close any editors
   when loading a new file, otherwise Sequencer64 can freeze.  In generally,
   we need to *manage* the various editing windows better.
-  In the pattern editor piano roll, implement Undo for the arrow keys in the
   same way as for the mouse.
-  The "increase size of grid" button on the perfedit doesn't work, or at least
   doesn't show any visual feedback.
x  In the perfedit window, make the vertical scroll go by 8 tracks instead of
   just 1.  This is now a configuration feature for both horizontal and
   vertical scrolling.
x  In the standard seq24 view, when a pattern is moved, it leaves a black
   line at the bottom of the pattern slot it just left.
-  Is the --pass-sysex command actually supported?  Seq24 threw SysEx away.
x  Consider adding support for reading normal MIDI TimeSig and Tempo data from
   normal MIDI files, as found in example1.mid; also get some other files to
   test.
x  Add support for SMF (MIDI format) 0.
y  Tighten up the is-dirty handling for all dialogs:
   x  Moving a pattern does not turn on any dirty bit, to allow an opportunity
      for saving.  This is a legacy bug.
   y  Can the perform object control all the is-dirty stuff?  All the GUIs use
      it!
   x  Just opening a sequence should not dirty the song.
   -  Just selecting some notes should not dirty the song.
   x  Cutting out sequences should cause a query for saving.
   x  Moving a pattern to another slot should dirty the song.
   x  Opening the performance editor should not dirty the song.
   -  Just entering draw mode in the performance editor should not
      dirty the song.
   -  Modifications in the performance editor should dirty the song.
      x  Moving a segment, whether by arrows or mouse.
      x  Adding a segment, whether by keys or mouse.
      x  Deleting a segment, whether by keys or mouse.
-  Implement, if possible, the "p/x" keys in the seqevent area.
-  Just noticed that snap is saved.  Where?  Is this a bug or a feature?
x  A second song editor view for reference?  This idea seems like it can
   work, with communicate through the perform object, perhaps.
x  Add an option that prevents the automatic saving of the "usr" configuration
   file on exit.  Currently, command-line settings like --bus get saved in
   the file, a bit of a surpise/annoyance.
-  When closing a file, either need to blank out or close any pattern-editor
   windows and the performance editor; something like that.
-  Document that right-click on the pattern editor left and right scrollbar
   arrows act like Home and End for the seqroll.
-  Better progress and status indicators:
   -  Show the following items in the sequence editor:
      -  The sequence number.
      -  The current "time" of the progress bar.
   -  Show the following items in the song editor:
      -  The current "time" of the "L" marker.
      -  The current "time" of the "R" marker.
   -  Would be nice to have the sequence editors and performance editor scroll
      to keep the progress bar in view.
   -  Would be nice to show the current time/tick/measure/bar in the tune as
      it plays.
   -  Would be nice to show the current note/time/tick/measure/bar in sequence
      editor and performance editor windows.
   -  Stop progress bar when pattern not playing in performance editor.
-  Would be nice to have a PAUSE button and PAUSE feature.
-  Add the legacy-format option to the "rc" configuration file?
-  Seq24/Sequencer64 do n0t write out the c_midictrl data for any sequences.
   Something to learn more about and fix.
-  Add optimization to write out minimal qmute etc. to the MIDI file when it is
   not being used.
-  Add swing-quantization to the seqedit menu.
-  Would be nice to be able to Ctrl-Home, Ctrl-End, Page Up, and Page Down
   in the Song Editor.
-  We now have the same file imported twice, into screen-set 1 and screen-set
   2.  Now can we have --bus n do n and n+1 (each next screen-set goes to the
   next buss?
-  Sometimes the editing of event values in the event data section
   will not work. The workaround is to do a Ctrl-A, and the click in
   the roll to deselect the selection; that makes the event value
   editing work again.
-  The pattern right-click Cut menu entry does not seem to work.
   The loop or pattern remains in place.  Is this actually meant to
   cut selected events?
-  While one is typing in the name of the set in this field, the
   keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  While one is typing in the number of the set in the Set number field,
   the keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  Right click to edit a new sequence automatically shows it in perfnames,
   but not in mainwid.
-  Should mark empty tracks in the background-sequence selector, or just not
   show them.  Very low priority.
-  More feedback when adding a new sequence:
   -  Create a new sequence and add some notes.  It will not appear in the
      patterns window until you click in the patterns window, in the same slot
      where New was selected.
   -  It would be nice if it were highlighted somehow, maybe cyan or dark grey
      or some color that contrasts a little with the default background color
      that it uses.  All we could get to work well was reddening the progress
      line.
   -  You also have to dick around in the song editor to get a new pattern to
      appear.
-  The display of the END marker is missing in the seqroll for a time signature
   of 7/4 and a length of 8 bars.
-  That 7/8:8 sequence, when draw-clicked into the song editor, takes up 14
   measures!!!  A 4/4 sequence takes up 1.
-  Create a long note and a short note.  Select the shorter note so it is
   orange.  Drag it over to the middle of the longer note.  Orange will
   cover the length of the short note, plus bleed over to the right to the end
   of the longer note.  Other minor issues with overlapping notes.
   Can get notes chopped and resized!
-  Could use a small view of a sequence, or at least the overall song,
   to see where you are in it.
-  Sometimes the editing of event values in the event data section
   will not work. The workaround is to do a Ctrl-A, and the click in
   the roll to deselect the selection; that makes the event value
   editing work again.
-  The pattern right-click Cut menu entry does not seem to work.
   The loop or pattern remains in place.  Is this actually meant to
   cut selected events?
-  While one is typing in the name of the set in this field, the
   keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  While one is typing in the number of the set in the Set number field,
   the keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  In midibus, make the buss name variable, instead of hard-wired to "seq24".
   It should be an optional command-line option, and default to "Seq64".
   And in the same module, function init_in() should use it as well.
   Like legacy mode, using a link named "seq24" to run the app should
   also change this name to seq24, as should --legacy itself!
   Also init_in_sub().
-  --manual_alsa_ports on the command line does NOT override the "rc"
   configuration file setting!
-  --manual_alsa_ports, etc., should be --manual-alsa_ports.
-  Can we provide a way to move a note a tiny amount without changing the beat
   size?
-  Ctrl-Z for data/event does n0t work unless the piano roll has the focus.
   Worth worrying about?
-  If POSSIBLE, avoid loading the "user" configuration file, or at least
   parts of it, when "manual-alsa-ports" is set to "1".
   -  ACTUALLY, THIS SEEMS TO BE WORKING PARTLY: the right busses are shown,
      but the sequencer64.usr file controllers and channels are still shown.
   -  Also what happens is that, if manual-alsa-ports is false, and the "user"
      file has entries, but fewer entries than what the system provides by
      default, then the additional system entries are visible.  NOT SURE IF
      THIS IS A BUG, A FEATURE, or A WARNING TO THE USER.
-  WEIRD!  Opening the File / Options / MIDI Input tab with "manual alsa"
   set to true, the port shown is "[1] seq24 1", not the  "[0] seq24 0"
   that I expected.  However, check this out:

      129:15   seq24                            [16] seq24 16
-  Provide an "infinite" pattern that will not repeat (unless specified
   multiple times in the performance editor).
   "Infinite" sequences, aka a "track" as opposed to a sequence.
   Or, perhaps the track can be set to any length (add 128 and 256
   to the list???), but be marked as a one-shot timer, set to inactive
   once it is done, never to sound again until the next playback.
-  Support for the Non Session Manager.
-  Muting in mainwid or perfnames should be reflected in both views.
-  Extra lines appearing in perfnames/perfroll when starting playback in
   perfroll.
-  Anyway to double-click a pattern to edit, without selecting it?
   Or by holding the Shift key or Mod4 key with the letter?
-  The 750 x 500 for sequence and song editor size should be configurable in
   the "user" file.
-  Selecting note events is iffy, more so than in legacy.
-  Would be nice if ctrl-arrow or some other key could shorten or lengthen the
   note by very small increments.
-  Would be nice if shift-left-click would deselect only the one note clicked
   on.
-  New stuff to implement in all relevant modules:
   -  Use of is_channel_msg(), is_one_byte_msg(), is_two_byte_msg()
   -  The new variants of the SEQ64_CLICK_xxxxx macros.
-  Get variable PPQN support fully working!
-  Update maintime to support use of the the current beat-width, instead of
   using 4 all the time.
-  Selecting some notes of the same value, and trying to elongate or shrink
   them can make a note of "infinite" length.
-  Finish adding elements to the "user" configuration file.
y  Offload the scale functionality to a new "scale" class.
y  Investigate adding wrappers for draw_drawable().  (Done for the most common
   use cases).
y  Would be nice to be able move selected notes in the seqroll using
   the arrow keys, in one-key and one-snap resoltion increments.
   See seq24seqroll.cpp, line 305.  Done.  Added keys for
   paint mode (p, Shift-P), left, right, down, and up, enabled if any notes
   are selected.  Still need to figure out what left, right, and home do
   otherwise, needs some graphical feedback.

         Another old fork, lacking mainwid and perfedit, but has a couple of
         nice ideas to examine.
x  Add one or two digits to the size of the "Sequence length in bars" field, at
   the expense of its pixmap button.  Add an "infinite" option to that value.
x  Why is the very first, empty sequence, missing its bottom row of numbers
   (except for the ui hot-key).  (It was a bug.)
x  Make the GUI box-drawing and number options for configure.ac.  They are
   now part of the "user" configuration file.  The basic appearance of the grid
   is also tailorable to some extent.
x  Make the font selectable from the "user" configuration file.
x  Add a number to the slot when empty, for clarity.  This is now an option in
   the "user" configuration file.
x  Try to add usage of left/right arrows to perftime to permit fine
   adjustments, if this cannot work by hold the ctrl or ctrl-shift keys.
   Need a more detailed view to get it accurate.  Or just adjust the snap.
   Anyway, now "l" and "r" turn on the arrow keys for moving the "L" and "R"
   markers.
x  Store new values c_musickey = 0x24240011 and c_musicscale = 0x24240012 in
   the proprietary header of the MIDI song, when legacy mode is not in force.
   Also the number of the background sequence, c_backsequence = 0x24240013.
   These are stored only if different from the defaults, so as not to waste
   space.  One minor issue, actually a long-standing feature, is that
   opening a key/scale/background-modified sequence causes any sequence opened
   thereafter to take on those values.  Perhaps too surprising or tricky a
   feature.  We might make this a GLOBAL setting, but more tricks abound.
x  Using SEQ64_ key and event macros instead of GDK_ key and event macros.
x  I forgotten instructions of use. 'p' to activate paint, 'P' (shift p) to
   deactivate.  Remember to "select" the piano roll instead of writing on other
   controls, like the name edit. that is a little tricky but you will overcome
   that.  ivan

      We have now incorporated this feature (2015-11-01).

Subject: Re: [sequencer64] Install-recursive and .seq24rc equivalent (#2)

Sorry to be so slow, all my free time is spent trying to get my upcoming
book across its jan15 finish line.  But (for deeply nerdy reasons,) I
always spend a bunch of my christmas vacation time learning new source
code, so I've set up a Netbeans environment for sequencer64 (I have to
confess I'm a Windows developer for a living and really gravitate towards
IDEs.  I've worked in linux for decades, but linux as an IDE breaks my
heart.)

In any event, after some code surfing and debugging, it looks like a lot of
the odd behavior I experience with mute groups is possibly because of the
line: if ((i == m_playing_screen) && m_tracks_mute_state[j])
in perform::mute_group_tracks () isn't working as I imagined it should.

Gdb tells me that m_playing_screen never changes from 0 regardless of the
m_screenset value.  I believe this is why, no matter what screen you're on
when you hit a mute group key, it ignores that screen and applies the mute
group to the first screen.

I'll try i == m_screenset as an alternative sometime in the next few days.
I just wanted to let you know I was still thinking about this.

From: Daniel Appelt <notifications@github.com>

This report might be seen as a follow up to #8 I am trying to use sequencer64 as
transport master for jack under Arch Linux When I hit play in sequencer64, the
playroll visualization in the top right corner of the main window is jumping
around very wildly

In the simplest setup, I just start these applications:

    - jack2 via jackdbus
    - qjackctl
    - sequencer64

In the options, I have just ticked the checkbox for "Transport Master" If I
hit play in sequencer64, I get the jumpy behavior as described above There is
no position indicator moving at all in the editor window In qjackctl, the BBT
display is also jumping, but that might be more or less okay as the value is
at least steadily increasing If I go down to 20bpm in sequencer64, suddenly I
can see the position indicator jumping around in the pattern editor

If, in addition, I send Midi clock signals from sequencer64 to Rebirth
(running under wine), Rebirth is syncing to a tempo of 500bpm while I was
expecting to see 104bpm which I have set in sequencer64 This might explain the
jumpy behavior described above The same setup works fine without synchronizing
the jack transport that is if no jack transport checkbox is ticked in the
options

In seq24, jack transport synchronization worked better (mostly) Seq24 does not
send correct Midi clock signals though

Subject: [sequencer64] Midi realtime clock messages are not in sync (#11)

With the current release 09915, Midi realtime clock messages are broken again
when connected to jack Currently, it seems that if sequencer64 is transport
master, the realtime clock messages indicate a much slower tempo than set in
sequencer64 If sequencer64 is jack transport "slave", the realtime clock
messages seem to indicate a much faster tempo

This was tested only against ReBirth windows application running on wine using
an ALSA Midi through port for communication from sequencer64 to wine/ReBirth

In theory, the problem should also be visible using a MIDI monitor application
connected to an ALSA Midi port that receives clock signals from sequencer64
(via first tab in options panel)

It works in 0.9.9.14 - I tested commit
`a4101685cd91a033450a13f70dc1208992881bd6` 
- if sequencer64 is jack transport master. Transport needs to be started from
sequencer64 in this case. I checked the diffs between this commit and the
current release but for me the changes/involved files were too complex.

Subject: Re: [sequencer64] Midi realtime clock messages are not in sync (#11)

I am using [GMIDImonitor](http://home.gna.org/gmidimonitor/) which is a very
basic monitoring tool together with qjackctl. GMIDImonitor needs to be started
with option `--alsa` for it to work with ALSA midi ports.

qjackctl is used to create ALSA midi connections and to test jack slave mode
in sequencer64.  For my tests I  use an ALSA "Midi Through Port" whose output
is patched to GMIDImonitor. Furthermore, you need to create a pattern in
sequencer64 containing only quarter  notes.

The output that is to be expected is that you will see 24 "MIDI Real Time
Clock"  messages in between two adjacent quarter notes. Unfortunately, right
now I am not seeing any notes at all being sent from sequencer64 - I am using
the commit that I mentioned earlier.

MY NOTES:

    Dan's rc file gives [0] 14:0 Midi Through Port-0, Clock = On (Pos)

	Okay, I got the setup working, and the latest "fixups" checkout seems to
	work the same as far as the clock goes.  I'm going to quit tonight, though.
	Getting tired.  But here's what I did to see notes.

	First, I used "midisnoop" instead of "gmidimonitor".  It shows count number
	and the timestamps as well.  I don't think this is relevant to the results,
	just easier to see what's happening and make tick-calculations.

	Second, I hooked the MIDI Through Port-0 to midisnoop's "MIDI input".
	I configured midisnoop with Driver = ALSA Sequencer, Input Port =
	MIDI Through 14:0, Output Port = none, and I unchecked "Ignore Time Events".

	Third, after running seq24 or sequencer64 ("fixups" latest) and loading
	the contrib/midi/click_4_4.midi file, I also opened the Song Editor
	and layed down a few copies of the pattern.  That was the key to actually
	seeing notes, I think.  I also enabled the "input goes to output" button,
	but I doubt that was the key.

    [ACTUALLY, that may be KEY as well, if played via the Song Editor.  Not
    sure.  Also, because of our reversion to legacy Seq24 ALSA playback
    behavior, one can use either the Song Editor or the Pattern Window to
    make the notes play.

	Anyway, I amm getting 24 clocks per quarter note with the latest code.
	The time values midisnoop shows are "timestamps", not tick numbers.
	There are about 500 timestamps per quarter note, the BPM is 120.

	So right now I think the code is working, but I will hack at it again
	tomorrow to be sure, when my eyes are not so bleary.

END OF MY NOTES.

Subject: Re: [sequencer64] Jack Transport Master behaviour is very "jumpy" (#10)

I have just tested version 0.9.9.16 and most of the problems seem to be gone
now!

There is only one thing left. If you stop the transport (sequencer64 is
transport master), and you use qjackctl or the carla / catia transport
functions to roll back transport to the beginning, and then start play back
again from one of those tools, the BPM information seems to be gone. The
behaviour is the same when using either qjackctl or carla or catia. For
example, BPM in qjackctl is then set to "6.953e-310", in catia it is displayed
as "0" after rolling back.

In general, the "roll back" should be added as a feature to sequencer64 -
maybe it is there but I don't know where.
'
    FIXED.
    
    However, if Sequencer64 is JACK slave, using qjackctl play button
    has the following features:

        -   It will not start Sequencer64.
        -   Qjackctl will show time advancing, but no BBT information.

    Adding Hydrogen as JACK Master then allows Hydrogen, Sequencer64, or Qjackctl     to start and stop the playback.

    It seems at least one JACK Master is needed.  Is this correct behavior?

    THAT SEEMS LIKELY.

`klick -j -P`

where -j means "follow jack transport BBT info (no tempo map)". This indeed
leads to the correct result with respect to the metronome!  So, for now, this
just leaves me with two issues when using the jack transport master option:

    - Midi clock signals seem to be wrong
    - visualisations are jumpy

    FIXED.

This means Sequencer64 is doing something wrong is saving hymne.mid when
PPQN == 384.  Other issues, too.

The error occurs near the end of the converted file, where the new SeqSpecs
for Key, Scale, and Background Sequence start.  It appears to be caused by a
bad length value following the c_mutegroups = 0x24240009 specification.

    gmutesz = 4228, adding 4 for data = 4232 (is this correct?), but
    the sequence of bytes sequencer64 (and seq24) yield is

        24 24 00 09 00 00 04 00 ... 00 with occasional nonzeroes

    write_prop_header(c_bpmtag, 07), 4:  len = 4+4 = 8, write
    00 FF 7F 08

    write_long(80): <todo>

    write_prop_header(c_mutegroups, 4228): len = 4228+4 = 4232, write
    00 FF 7F A1 08 24 24 00 09
                    ^
                    |__ 0x1ef3, ends at 2f7b

    This translates to 2f7a - 1ef3 + 1 = 1088 bytes, or 4232 bytes.

    This is then followed with 00 FF 7F 05 24 24 00 11 00 and 00 FF 7F....

    Could this be a bug in midicvt?

    WORK SUSPENDED FOR NOW.

Note that we added time-signature and tempo support, but have not fixed the
garbage that appears via midicvt.
