Bugs and Additional Upgrade Ideas
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-10-27 to 2016-04-02 (New bugs)

In no particular order...  "y" means "in progress", and "x" means it is
basically done.

-  See BUG REPORTS below.  These are bug reports from other people.
x  allofarow.mid:
   x    Load the allofarow.mid tune while in JACK mode.  It loads as 140 BPM,
        but plays really slowly!
   x    In ALSA mode, it loads as 140 BPM, but plays normally.
   x    In seq24, it loads as 120 BPM, but plays somewhat normally (just a tad
        slow).
   x    Saving it in Sequencer64 format and reload it, it plays fine in JACK
        mode, live or song mode.  Comes up as BPM = 140, too.
   The problem was an actual bug in reading and translating the time signature
   in this file.  We had it as 2/16, and it was actually 4/4!  It is somewhat
   hidden because Sequencer64/Seq24 has another MIDI construct that works
   correctly to get the time signature.
y  It seems like note-off is not working when the song is stopped or paused
   now.  This is fixed for ALSA, but not for JACK.
-  It would be good to have a command that dumps the current build settings
   for Sequencer64.  Actually, add it to the --version command.
y  Pause Support:
   -    ALSA: Live Mode supports resume-from-pause, Song Mode does not.
        Is this a BUG, or a FEATURE?
   -    Currently, stop (Escape) in seqroll makes the cursor disappear, and
        then playback resumes from pause.  The cursor rewinds, but then
        reappears as if a pause was performed.
   x    In the main window, the pause/play button works, but the space bar
        plays only a tiny bit each time it is pressed.  This is triggered
        by hitting the play/pause button; but it does not happen for the real
        pause key (the period).  This bug occurs if configured with
        --disable-pause, and also occurs in seq24!  FIXED.  It turns out that
        the buttons in the main windows would grab the focus when clicked, so
        that the space bar would not only do its normal function, but also
        click the button!  Had to call a function to turn off the ability of a
        number of the buttons to grab focus.
   x    Seems to be susceptible to notes not being turned off
        (but check the MIDI bus flush as well).  We need to make sure that
        stop and pause both silence all notes, somehow.
   x    It also seems to disable start-stop from Seq64 in JACK mode.
        This is also true in the latest code even if PAUSE SUPPORT is
        OFF.
   y    If start key == stop key, they become stop/pause.  Allow
        Esc to automatically be stop (not pause), then.
x  The pattern editor ends up zipping to the end of the pattern
   after a few start/stops, in JACK mode only.  Fixed by rewinding
   in qjackctl; seems to start when using space-bar toggle in perfedit.
   Accompanied by a glitch in transport, jumping a few bars.
   Actually seems to happen at the beginning of the triggers at the
   performance gap (in the b4uacuse alternate tune).  This bug goes
   back to at least 0.9.9.18, i.e. before the PAUSE SUPPORT.  Fixed by
   not calling set_running() if JACK is active.
-  Shift Click:
   -    Make it toggle muting of all the other patterns in the patterns
        window, the same way it does it in the perfnames window.
   -    Also see if feasible to show mutes status that mirror each other.
-  If a MIDI buss override number is provided, it is not applied to a new
   sequence.  Is this a bug or a feature?
x  The GUI now comes up not showing the "pill" progress bar until the tune
   starts. Fixed, was a comparison error in maintime::idle_progress().
-  Get variable PPQN support fully working.
-  Support for the Non Session Manager.
-  Write up a procedure for using nsm-proxy as Daniel Appelt notes.
-  Add JACK-fuzzing code feature for testing and stressing JACK transport and
   other JACK transport clients.
-  The vertical scroll feature in seqdata immediately puts the data value at
   0, but otherwise works fine, adjusting it up and down properly.
-  Make sure that Sequencer64 handles running status, via the files that
   midicvt discusses.
-  We need to be able to empty out any sequences and close any editors
   when loading a new file, otherwise Sequencer64 can freeze.  In generally,
   we need to *manage* the various editing windows better.
-  In the pattern editor piano roll, implement Undo for the arrow keys in the
   same way as for the mouse.
-  The "increase size of grid" button on the perfedit doesn't work, or at least
   doesn't show any visual feedback.
-  Is the --pass-sysex command actually supported?  Seq24 threw SysEx away.
y  Tighten up the is-dirty handling for all dialogs:
   y  Can the perform object control all the is-dirty stuff?  All the GUIs use
      it!
   -  Just selecting some notes should not dirty the song.
   -  Just entering draw mode in the performance editor should not
      dirty the song.
   -  Modifications in the performance editor should dirty the song.
      x  Moving a segment, whether by arrows or mouse.
      x  Adding a segment, whether by keys or mouse.
      x  Deleting a segment, whether by keys or mouse.
-  Implement, if possible, the "p/x" keys in the seqevent area.
-  Just noticed that snap is saved.  Where?  Is this a bug or a feature?
-  When closing a file, either need to blank out or close any pattern-editor
   windows and the performance editor; something like that.
-  Document that right-click on the pattern editor left and right scrollbar
   arrows act like Home and End for the seqroll.
-  Better progress and status indicators:
   -  Show the following items in the sequence editor:
      -  The sequence number.
      -  The current "time" of the progress bar.
   -  Show the following items in the song editor:
      -  The current "time" of the "L" marker.
      -  The current "time" of the "R" marker.
   -  Would be nice to have the performance editor scroll to keep the
      progress bar in view.  Already done for sequence editor.
   -  Would be nice to show the current note/time/tick/measure/bar in all of
      the windows.
y  Would be nice to have a PAUSE button and PAUSE feature.
-  Seq24/Sequencer64 do not write out the c_midictrl data for any sequences.
   Something to learn more about and fix.
-  Add optimization to write out minimal qmute etc. to the MIDI file when it is
   not being used.
-  Add swing-quantization to the seqedit menu.
-  Would be nice to be able to Ctrl-Home, Ctrl-End, Page Up, and Page Down
   in the Song Editor.
-  We now have the same file imported twice, into screen-set 1 and screen-set
   2.  Now can we have --bus n do n and n+1 (each next screen-set goes to the
   next buss?
-  Sometimes the editing of event values in the event data section
   will not work. The workaround is to do a Ctrl-A, and the click in
   the roll to deselect the selection; that makes the event value
   editing work again.
-  The pattern right-click Cut menu entry does not seem to work.
   The loop or pattern remains in place.  Is this actually meant to
   cut selected events?
-  While one is typing in the name of the set in this field, the
   keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  While one is typing in the number of the set in the Set number field,
   the keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  Right click to edit a new sequence automatically shows it in perfnames,
   but not in mainwid.
-  Should mark empty tracks in the background-sequence selector, or just not
   show them.
-  For a time signature of 7/4 and a length of 8 bars, that 7/8:8 sequence,
   when draw-clicked into the song editor, takes up 14 measures, until the
   song editor is also set to 7/4.
-  Create a long note and a short note.  Select the shorter note so it is
   orange.  Drag it over to the middle of the longer note.  Orange will
   cover the length of the short note, plus bleed over to the right to the end
   of the longer note.  Other minor issues with overlapping notes.
   Can get notes chopped and resized!
-  Could use a small view of a sequence, or at least the overall song,
   to see where you are in it.
-  Sometimes the editing of event values in the event data section
   will not work. The workaround is to do a Ctrl-A, and the click in
   the roll to deselect the selection; that makes the event value
   editing work again.
-  The pattern right-click Cut menu entry does not seem to work.
   The loop or pattern remains in place.  Is this actually meant to
   cut selected events?
-  While one is typing in the name of the set in this field, the
   keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  While one is typing in the number of the set in the Set number field,
   the keystrokes will affect the panel window, causing playback to
   start and pattern boxes to be toggled!
-  In midibus, make the buss name variable, instead of hard-wired to "seq24".
   It should be an optional command-line option, and default to "Seq64".
   And in the same module, function init_in() should use it as well.
   Like legacy mode, using a link named "seq24" to run the app should
   also change this name to seq24, as should --legacy itself!
   Also init_in_sub().
-  --manual-alsa-ports on the command line does NOT override the "rc"
   configuration file setting!
-  Can we provide a way to move a note a tiny amount without changing the beat
   size?
-  Ctrl-Z for data/event does n0t work unless the piano roll has the focus.
   Worth worrying about?
-  If POSSIBLE, avoid loading the "user" configuration file, or at least
   parts of it, when "manual-alsa-ports" is set to "1".
   -  ACTUALLY, THIS SEEMS TO BE WORKING PARTLY: the right busses are shown,
      but the sequencer64.usr file controllers and channels are still shown.
   -  Also what happens is that, if manual-alsa-ports is false, and the "user"
      file has entries, but fewer entries than what the system provides by
      default, then the additional system entries are visible.  NOT SURE IF
      THIS IS A BUG, A FEATURE, or A WARNING TO THE USER.
-  WEIRD!  Opening the File / Options / MIDI Input tab with "manual alsa"
   set to true, the port shown is "[1] seq24 1", not the  "[0] seq24 0"
   that I expected.  However, check this out:
      % arecordmidi -l
       Port    Client name                      Port name
       14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
      129:0    seq24                            [1] seq24 1
      129:1    seq24                            [2] seq24 2
      129:2    seq24                            [3] seq24 3
       ...      ...                                 ...
      129:15   seq24                            [16] seq24 16
-  Provide an "infinite" pattern that will not repeat (unless specified
   multiple times in the performance editor).
   "Infinite" sequences, aka a "track" as opposed to a sequence.
   Or, perhaps the track can be set to any length (add 128 and 256
   to the list???), but be marked as a one-shot timer, set to inactive
   once it is done, never to sound again until the next playback.
-  Muting in mainwid or perfnames should be reflected in both views.
-  Extra lines appearing in perfnames/perfroll when starting playback in
   perfroll.
-  The 750 x 500 for sequence and song editor size should be configurable in
   the "user" file.
-  Would be nice if ctrl-arrow or some other key could shorten or lengthen the
   note by very small increments.
-  Would be nice if shift-left-click would deselect only the one note clicked
   on.
-  Update maintime to support use of the the current beat-width, instead of
   using 4 all the time.
-  Selecting some notes of the same value, and trying to elongate or shrink
   them can make a note of "infinite" length.
y  Offload the scale functionality to a new "scale" class.
-  Still need to figure out what left, right, and home do
   otherwise, needs some graphical feedback.
y  Initiatives from other projects ("-" means "not done (yet)", "y" means
   "partially done", "x" means done, "0" means "will not do"):

BUG REPORTS:

Date: Sat, 19 Dec 2015 20:48:34 -0800
From: Tim Deagan <notifications@github.com>

In any event, after some code surfing and debugging, it looks like a lot of
the odd behavior I experience with mute groups is possibly because of the
line: if ((i == m_playing_screen) && m_tracks_mute_state[j])
in perform::mute_group_tracks () isn't working as I imagined it should.

Gdb tells me that m_playing_screen never changes from 0 regardless of the
m_screenset value.  I believe this is why, no matter what screen you're on
when you hit a mute group key, it ignores that screen and applies the mute
group to the first screen.

I will try i == m_screenset as an alternative sometime in the next few days.
I just wanted to let you know I was still thinking about this.

    FIXED

This report might be seen as a follow up to #8 I am trying to use sequencer64 as
transport master for jack under Arch Linux When I hit play in sequencer64, the
playroll visualization in the top right corner of the main window is jumping
around very wildly

In seq24, jack transport synchronization worked better (mostly) Seq24 does not
send correct Midi clock signals though

    FIXED

Date: Tue, 02 Feb 2016 15:22:42 -0800
From: Daniel Appelt <notifications@github.com>

With the current release 09915, Midi realtime clock messages are broken again
when connected to jack Currently, it seems that if sequencer64 is transport
master, the realtime clock messages indicate a much slower tempo than set in
sequencer64 If sequencer64 is jack transport "slave", the realtime clock
messages seem to indicate a much faster tempo

    FIXED

Date: Thu, 04 Feb 2016 14:39:35 -0800
From: Daniel Appelt <notifications@github.com>

I am using [GMIDImonitor](http://home.gna.org/gmidimonitor/) which is a very
basic monitoring tool together with qjackctl. GMIDImonitor needs to be started
with option `--alsa` for it to work with ALSA midi ports.

qjackctl is used to create ALSA midi connections and to test jack slave mode
in sequencer64.  For my tests I  use an ALSA "Midi Through Port" whose output
is patched to GMIDImonitor. Furthermore, you need to create a pattern in
sequencer64 containing only quarter  notes.

The output that is to be expected is that you will see 24 "MIDI Real Time
Clock"  messages in between two adjacent quarter notes. Unfortunately, right
now I am not seeing any notes at all being sent from sequencer64 - I am using
the commit that I mentioned earlier.

    FIXED

Date: Sun, 07 Feb 2016 16:04:09 -0800
From: Daniel Appelt <notifications@github.com>

There is only one thing left. If you stop the transport (sequencer64 is
transport master), and you use qjackctl or the carla / catia transport
functions to roll back transport to the beginning, and then start play back
again from one of those tools, the BPM information seems to be gone. The
behaviour is the same when using either qjackctl or carla or catia. For
example, BPM in qjackctl is then set to "6.953e-310", in catia it is displayed
as "0" after rolling back.

    FIXED.

`klick -j -P`

where -j means "follow jack transport BBT info (no tempo map)". This indeed
leads to the correct result with respect to the metronome!  So, for now, this
just leaves me with two issues when using the jack transport master option:

    - Midi clock signals seem to be wrong
    - visualisations are jumpy

    FIXED.

Date: Fri, 29 Jan 2016

% midicvt hymne-seq64.midi hymne-seq64.asc
% ? Error at MIDI file offset 12155 [0x2f7b]
% Error: Garbage at end 'readtrack(): unexpected running status'

% midicvt hymne-ppqn-384.mid hymne-ppqn-384.asc
? Error at MIDI file offset 12488 [0x30c8]
Error: Garbage at end 'readtrack(): unexpected running status'

This means Sequencer64 is doing something wrong is saving hymne.mid when
PPQN == 384.  Other issues, too.

The error occurs near the end of the converted file, where the new SeqSpecs
for Key, Scale, and Background Sequence start.  It appears to be caused by a
bad length value following the c_mutegroups = 0x24240009 specification.

    gmutesz = 4228, adding 4 for data = 4232 (is this correct?), but
    the sequence of bytes sequencer64 (and seq24) yield is

        24 24 00 09 00 00 04 00 ... 00 with occasional nonzeroes

    write_prop_header(c_bpmtag, 07), 4:  len = 4+4 = 8, write
    00 FF 7F 08

    write_long(80): <todo>

    write_prop_header(c_mutegroups, 4228): len = 4228+4 = 4232, write
    00 FF 7F A1 08 24 24 00 09
                    ^
                    |__ 0x1ef3, ends at 2f7b

    This translates to 2f7a - 1ef3 + 1 = 1088 bytes, or 4232 bytes.

    This is then followed with 00 FF 7F 05 24 24 00 11 00 and 00 FF 7F....

    Could this be a bug in midicvt?

    WORK SUSPENDED FOR NOW.

Note that we added time-signature and tempo support, but have not fixed the
garbage that appears via midicvt.


Date: Tue, 02 Feb 2016 15:32:40 -0800                                             
From: Daniel Appelt <notifications@github.com>                                    
                                                                                  
Manual NSM support may be achieved using the nsm-proxy helper client. sequencer64 
and seq24 both support signals SIGUSR1 (saving) and SIGINT (closing). You just    
have to provide an initial Midi file to work on in the directory created for the  
proxy, and specify its file name as command line argument.                       
                                                                                  
There is even a helper script to support this scenario in
[github](https://github.com/rhetr/nsm-scripts/blob/master/scripts/seq24-nsm).
Please note that this script expects to find an (empty) Midi file in
`~/.local/share/seq24/blank.midi`.
