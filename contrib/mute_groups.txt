Mute-Group Explorations

In this document we explore mute-groups, how they might work, and
Tim's fixes to them.  The primary module under discussion is the
perform module.

   m_play_screen_offset:

      This is a variable I introduced to save some multiplications.
      It is set to m_playing_screen * m_seqs_in_set in the
      perform::set_playing_screenset() function.

      That function is called in handle_midi_control() to implement the
      c_midi_control_play_ss command.  Also called in
      perform::mainwnd_key_event() to handle the keypress in mainwnd.

      perform::set_playing_screenset() also sets m_playing_screen to the
      selected screen-set.

      m_play_screen_offset is also used in select_group_mute().  That function
      acts if m_mode_group_learn is true.  It gets the playing status of all
      the sequences in the "playing" screenset and sets each mute-group member
      in that screenset to the that playing status.

   m_screenset [replaces m_playscreen_offset in the select_mute_group()
   function, but the usage makes it essentially replace m_playing_screen.
