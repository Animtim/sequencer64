INSTALL for Sequencer64 v 0.9.9.6
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-09-10 to 2015-10-30

The current packaging for Sequencer64 is primarily aimed at developers.
There is currently no configure script... it must be bootstrapped.

Steps:

   0.  Preload any DEPENDENCIES, as listed at the end of this document.
       However, if some are missing, the configure script will tell you,
       or, at worst, a buld error will tell you.

   1.  Check-out the branch you want.  Make a branch if you want to make
       changes.

   2. From the top project directory, run the commands:

      $ ./bootstrap
      $ ./configure

      For debugging without libtool getting in the way, just run the
      following command, which will add the --enable-debug and
      --disable-shared options to a configure run:

      $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug

   3. Run the make command:

      $ make

      If you do not care about the documentation and debian packaging,
      change to the various sub-project directories before running make.

   4. To install, become root and run:

      # make install

CONFIGURE OPTIONS FOR APPLICATION FEATURES:

    --disable-highlight

        Undefines the SEQ64_HIGHLIGHT_EMPTY_SEQS  macro, which is
        otherwise defined by default.  If defined, the application will
        highlight empty sequences/patterns by coloring them yellow.

    --disable-lash

        Undefines the SEQ64_LASH_SUPPORT macro, which is otherwise defined
        by default.

    --disable-jack
    
        Undefines the SEQ64_JACK_SUPPORT macro, which is otherwise defined
        by default.

    --disable-jack-session

        Undefines the SEQ64_JACK_SUPPORT macro, which is defined if JACK
        support is defined, and the jack/session.h file is found.

MACROS IN CODE:

    The following items are not yet part of the configure script, but can
    be edited manually to achieve the desired setting:

    SEQ64_USE_NEW_FONT

        Already defined in the font.cpp module.  If defined, a new,
        anti-aliased, bold font is used in the user-interface.  This
        new font is implement in new XPM files in resources/pixmaps:
        wen*.xpm.  The font is slightly larger, but changes the
        user-interface sizes only to an infinitesmal degree.

    USE_GREY_GRID

        If defined, this item causes the pattern slots/boxes to be colored
        grey.  Otherwise, they are colored black.  By default, this value
        is defined (in the mainwid module).

    USE_NORMAL_GRID:

        If defined, the box that outlines the pattern slots/boxes is
        painted over to convert the box to look like a pair of brackets.
        By default, this value is defined (in the mainwid module).

    Defining both of the macros gives the normal Seq24 look for the
    Pattern Window.  Eventually we might move these definitions into the
    configure script, for easier modification.

DEPENDENCIES:

   With luck, the following dependencies will bring in their own
   dependencies when installed.

      -  libsigc++-2.0-dev
      -  libjack-jackd2-dev
      -  liblash-compat-dev (optional)

   Runtime:
