Chris Ahlstrom
2015-09-10 to 2017-02-20 (initial work started in July of 2015)

This file collects major changes that are older and would clutter up
the README file.

Older major updates:

    -   Version 0.9.20:
        -   Fixed issue 50, where opening and closing a seqedit, and then
            modifying the buss or channel of that sequence from the
            main window slot right-click menu would cause a segfault.
        -   Also fixed a minor issue with the progress bar being invisible
            in an armed sequence.
        -   Beefed up the LFO control window and added clarifying tooltips for
            it.  Still currently needs the --enable-lfo configure option in
            order to be activated.
        -   Added new rc "allow-click-edit" option to disable bringing up the
            pattern editor with a double-click (issue #51).
        -   Fixed broken seq32 fast-forward and rewind functionality.
    -   Version 0.9.19:
        -   Fixed issue 46, pattern-edit undo being applied twice.
        -   Fixed keystrokes meant for pattern edit fields being used to 
            modify the sequence piano roll.
        -   Main window Mute button is disabled in Song mode to avoid
            confusing behavior.
        -   Progress bar shown in pattern editor for empty sequences.
        -   Some cleanup of playback handling.
        -   Fixed issue 42, where recording a MIDI note was inadvertently of
            fixed length.
        -   Fixed issue 43, where MIDI files with upper-case extensions were
            not shown.
        -   Closed out a number of already-fixed issues.
    -   Version 0.9.18.3:
        -   Bug in cut-and-paste in the sequence editor.  When cutting (not
            just copying), the event clipboard would be cleared and be
            unpastable.
    -   Version 0.9.18.2:
        -   Fixed incorrect loading, saving, and usage of MIDI controls
            feature.
        -   Fixed Song mode and Song Editor interactions.
        -   Updated the Debian package build process.
    -   Version 0.9.18.1:
        -   Fixed a bug in perfedit looping.
        -   Fixed a segfault when modifying an event in the event editor.
        -   Fixed a bug that disabled editing in the Song Editor if an
            inactive sequence was clicked in.
        -   KNOWN BUG:  In this release, Song mode will work only if the
            Song/Live button is activated.  This could be a feature :-)
    -   Version 0.9.18:
        -   Added new buttons in the main window for easier control of muting,
            live/song mode, and menu enabling.  (From Seq32).
        -   Added more hotkeys and a second keys page to the Options dialog
            (From Seq32).
        -   Added a Tap-BPM button and hotkey.
        -   Can now edit the text fields in the main window without triggering
            patterns.
        -   Improved the handling of wrap-around notes in a pattern.
        -   Fixed a segfault in the zoom functionality.
        -   A bad bug in the Song Editor (acting on the wrong pattern) was
            fixed.  I am an idiot.
    -   Version 0.9.17.2:
        -   A regression in the handling of muting in Live mode was fixed.
    -   Version 0.9.17.1:
        -   An important regression/bug for JACK transport support.  I am
            so embarrassed!  It seems to be fixed; basically one line of code
            accidentally commented out.
    -   Version 0.9.17:
        -   Added export of a Sequencer64 song performance as a MIDI file,
            where the MIDI file is laid out as per the song triggers in the
            performance editor.  The triggers are preserved in the exported
            file, but any sequencer can read the performance and will ignore
            the Sequencer64-specific triggers.
        -   Added an "inverse colors" options so that the user interface is a
            bit less bright in a "night" environment.  Also, the progress bar
            can be changed to a number of different colors.
        -   Added an optional Edit menu and the export of a song performance
            to a non-Sequencer64 MIDI file.  (Stazed feature).
        -   Ctrl-Left-Click in the Song Editor now works as a middle-click,
            to split the song trigger in half.
        -   The seq32 feature of splitting at the nearest snap point near
            a middle-click, in the Song Editor, has been added as an optional
            feature.
        -   Started adding support for recording incoming MIDI to the
            sequences that match the incoming channel data. (Stazed feature).
            This is a run-time option, and can be set from the Options dialog,
            the command-line, and in the "rc" configuration file.
        -   Enabled actual support for the recording-volume feature, which was
            not actually used in seq24.
        -   Added better support for undo/redo ability from the stazed project
            (seq32).
        -   Added support for a lot of other stazed (seq32) features and
            extensions, macroed out until we can get them complete and
            finalized.  Some, noted above, are now available.
        -   Added the LFO window module code and refactored it, not yet
            available through the user interface, must be enabled in the code.
        -   Playback status now folded completely into the perform and
            jack_assistant classes.
        -   Lots of bug fixed based on fixes from seq32.  Also merged a
            fix from Arnaud for issue "MIDI controller toggles the wrong
            pattern", a regression caused by my fat fingers.
        -   See earlier version fixes near the end of this README.
    -   Version 0.9.16:
        -   If there is no mute-group information, it is no longer written
            to the MIDI file (unless --legacy is in force).  Saves 4000+
            bytes.  It can be disabled with build option --disable-mutestrip.
        -   Fixed bug in detecting the --jack-session-uuid option.
        -   Hardwired Ctrl-L as an alternative to the "L" (learn) button,
            and added automatic "Caps Lock" when in Learn mode, for keyboards
            that disable Caps Lock.
        -   Fixes and testing of replace, queue, and mute-groups.
        -   Much cleanup and optimization.
    -   Version 0.9.15.1 and .2:
        -   Fixing corner-case issues with saving the configuration.
            Transpose state saved with each pattern.
        -   Moved transpose support to the perform class.
        -   Red-colored events in non-transposable patterns (e.g. drums).
        -   Addition menu entries for muting/unmuting.
        -   Fixed perfedit continual-refresh bug.
        -   Prevent pathological note alterations when growing/shrinking
            selected notes.
    -   Version 0.9.15:
        -   Added the Stazed song-transpose feature from his Seq32 project.
        -   Additional sequence menu entries.
        -   Fixed a bug in muting/unmuting all tracks.
    -   Version 0.9.14:  Apart from some bug fixes and tweaks, the following
        major features have been added:
        -   Chord generation in the pattern editor, similar to what the 
            seq32 project has, but it can be disabled via the configure step.
        -   The song editor now pages horizontally to follow the progress bar.
    -   Version 0.9.13:
        -   Includes an important bug-fix from user 0rel that caused some
            notes to be missing or messed up in a copy operation in the
            pattern editor.
        -   Adds nearly complete support for moving, paging, and going to
            start and end both horizontally and vertically in the song editor
            and the pattern editor using keystrokes. 
        -   Copied note selections can be moved around using the arrow keys
            and pasted using the Enter key.
        -   Note copy/paste/move pattern-editor operations have been fixed or
            improved, and non-note events are handled better, instead of being
            stripped.
        -   Initial support for growing/stretching selected events via
            ctrl-left-arrow and ctrl-right-arrow.  Also, the Enter key
            finishes and then cancels a number of operations: paste, grow,
            move, and selection.
    -   Version 0.9.12 fixes a bug in the drawing of MIDI note numbers in the
        seqkeys panel.
