2015-09-10 to 2018-08-12

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24, extending it with new features and bug fixes.
The heart of seq24 remains intact.  It is an old friend, and maintains some
backward-compatibility with the --legacy option.  An extensive manual is
found at https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git.  Prebuilt Debian
packages, source tarballs, and Windows installers are available:

    https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages.git.

Sequencer64 has quite a few builds providing support for ALSA, PortMidi, JACK,
and Gtkmm 2.4, Qt 5, and command-line user-interfaces.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Sequencer64 has native JACK MIDI and Transport, with virtual/manual ports
    and auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The JACK version without a GUI.  Currently controlled via MIDI control
    events (start/stop events must be set up), it relies on a good working
    configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  Currently the only
    way to load a MIDI file is as the last argument on the command line.  We
    hope to add an OSC harness eventually.  It supports a "daemonize" option
    and dumping status to a log-file in the user-configuration directory.

Windows support (derived from PortMidi):

    This version uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34, but using the
    standard Sequencer64 libraries.  The user-interface works, and Windows
    built-in MIDI devices are detected, inaccessible devices are ignored, and
    playback (e.g. to the built-in wavetable synthesizer) work. It can be
    built easily via Qt Creator or qmake, using the MingW support of Qt.

    The Qt 5 GUI is well behind the Gtkmm 2.4 GUI for many features.
    That will be fixed bit-by-bit (help wanted!).  In the meantime,
    some configuration can be done manually in the "rc" and "usr" files.
    See README.windows for more information.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions or using a
conventional source tarball.

Recent changes:

    -   Version 0.95.1:  A lot of stuff for a "minor" release! We are
        conserving version numbers, plus most fixes are getting the Qt 5
        version as functional as the Gtkmm-2.4 version of the GUI.
        -   Cleaned up the Build Info dialog and enhanced the About dialog.
        -   See "Pull Request #150" in the NEWS file.
        -   Added the ability to read Cakewalk "WRK" files.
        -   Refactoring the "qseq" classes to avoid constant redraws.
        -   More work on getting Qt version of seqedit to handle the same
            features as seqedit.
        -   Fixed seq64 to match seq24/qpseq64 for displaying beats and
            measures properly in seqedit when the time-signature is changed.
        -   Double precision for BPM in Qt user-interface.
        -   Fixed issue #130 where editing event data (seqdata) would
            be slow/jerky with large patterns.
        -   Fixed issues building Qt/rtmidi executable with automake.
        -   Added an external pattern-editor window and song-editor window
            for the Qt user-interface, plus an LFO window.
        -   Made the Seq32 transpose option permanent, not macroed.
        -   Adding progress-following for the pattern and song editors.
        -   Enhanced MIDI file PPQN handling, and added an option to use the
            PPQN in the MIDI file, if present.  Use "--ppqn 0" or set the
            "user" file "midi_ppqn" value to 0.
        -   Fixed the broken "Expand" and "Replace" options in the sequence
            editor (still working on the Qt version).
    -   Version 0.95.0:
        -   Improved the Windows version and its packaging.  Added a Windows
            icon, an installer, better data support and documentation, and
            upgrades to the GUI.
        -   Added the ability to ignore ports that cannot be opened, and to
            report them.  Needed for Windows.
        -   Fixed display of event data values in the Gtkmm GUI.
        -   Fixed broken "replace loop" recording functionality (Linux).
        -   Fixed broken "expand loop" recording functionality (Linux).
        -   As usual, a raft of minor improvements.
    -   For earlier version information, see the NEWS and ChangeLog files.

This package is oriented to developers and users who do not mind building from
source, with a little help.  It is fairly well organized and well documented.
Please see the INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015, when I was laid
up after some old-man surgery.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.  Also see
contrib/notes/bugs_to_investigate.  Sequencer64 is documented by the following
project, a 190+-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
