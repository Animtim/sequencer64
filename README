README for Sequencer64 0.90.6 (Native JACK and CLI)

2015-09-10 to 2017-05-13

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24.  It extends seq24 in features and bug fixes;
the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the screenshot.  It is an old friend,
and maintains more backward-compatibility with the --legacy option.  See
https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git.  For prebuilt Debian
packages, see https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages.git.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Sequencer64 now has native JACK MIDI support, with virtual/manual ports
    and auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The JACK version without a GUI.  Currently controlled only via MIDI
    control events (start and stop events must be set up), it relies on a good
    working configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  Currently
    the only way to load a MIDI file is as the last argument on the command
    line.  We hope to add an OSC harness and command application eventually.
    Supports a "daemonize" option and dumping status to a log-file in the
    user-configuration directory.

With the big version jump from 0.9 to 0.90, the install process has changed.
See the INSTALL file.

    -   Version 0.90.6:
        -   Added the Stazed Seq32 upgrade to allow, in addition to
            merge-on-record, overwrite-on-record and expand-measures on
            record.
        -   Added Jean-Emmanuel beats-per-measure and measure text-editing
            support to support arbitrary values, issue #xx.
        -   Added Jean-Emmanuel seqmenu crash when pasting empty clipboard,
            issue #80.
        -   Added Jean-Emmanuel feature of a scrollable main window,
            conditionally built, pull request #82.
    -   Version 0.90.5:
        -   Added a queued-replace (queued-solo) feature.  It works only with
            the current (in-view) screen-set.  See issue #74.
        -   Made the strip-mutes option permanent.
        -   Fixed a crash in ALSA when input goes to output to input (MIDI
            feedback) with an app like VMPK.
        -   Fixed issue #76 where the JACK Connect Button was the wrong kind
            of button, and we had enabled making Gtk warnings fatal.
        -   Tightened up the event editor, but it is still easy to make it
            crash by adding multiple duplicate events; and they all are shown
            only as a single event.
    -   Version 0.90.4:
        -   Replaces 0.91.0 for now.
        -   Fixed issue #75 where program-change and channel-pressure were
            stripped.
        -   Fixed issue #72 where "ghost" mute-groups were appearing due
            to an error in scanning the mute-group section.
        -   Added a menu command to clear mute groups.  This affects MIDI
            files that contain mute group information.
        -   Added a menu command to reload the mute groups from the "rc" file.
        -   Improved the CLI version, still MIDI control only.  Still handles
            only one MIDI file, passed on the command-line.  Added usable
            "daemonize" and "log=file" options.
    -   Version 0.90.3:
        -   Added a console/daemon (no GUI) version, seq64cli. Configure this
            one with "./bootstrap -er -cli".  Still a work in progress, many
            issues remain.
        -   Fixed a bug in detecting Note On events with 0 velocity.
        -   Fixed issue #69, pass-thru button not working correctly
        -   Fixed issue #71, bad handling of Live mode pattern clicks.
        -   Updated the Debian package-creation "code".
    -   Version 0.90.2:
        -   BACKPORTED a BUG FIX from wip 0.91.0 to fix issue with
            detecting Note On velocity 0!
        -   Fixed weird parsing bug in configfile module.
        -   Fixed incomplete implementation of MIDI stop, start, continue, and
            song-position events, issue #67.
        -   Extended MIDI controls for Stop / Pause / Start, and coarse BPM
            settings.  Precursor to issue #64 ("no GUI").  Partial fix for
            issue #56 ("more midi control").
        -   Converted BPM to a double-precision value, and made the number of
            digits of precision for beats/minute configurable to 0, 1, or 2.
            Takes care of issue #63.
        -   Some minor bugs, such as mute status (mainwid) and playback status
            (seqedit) not being in synch.
        -   Functions for SEQ64_APP_NAME and SEQ64_CLIENT_NAME.
        -   Upgraded the Debian packaging setup.
    -   Version 0.90.1:
        -   Fixes a JACK naming and connection issue when accessing ports
            exposed by a2jmidid.
        -   Fixes a long-standing (back to seq24) issue where the Free
            selection in the pattern editor would still set the MIDI input to
            a fixed velocity.
        -   Double-precision tempo added.
    -   Version 0.90.0:
        -   Initial support for using a heavily-refactored RtMidi spinoff
            library to support native JACK MIDI (as opposed to just JACK
            transport).  RtMidi turned out not to match the model of
            Sequencer64 very well, so to call it an "RtMidi" version is very
            misleading.
        -   PortMidi has been activated!  Builds and runs in Linux, still
            need to set up Gtk for Windows.  However, it has issues currently,
            and we are going to eventually deprecate it.
    -   For more version information, see the NEWS file.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  It is fairly well
organized, fairly well documented, and less mysterious (to us, anyway) than
before.  Please see the INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.  Also see
contrib/notes/bugs_to_investigate.  Sequencer64 is well-documented by the
following project, which provides a 170+-page PDF file and its LaTeX source
code:

Legacy Sequencer64: Sequencer64/sequencer64

    This is the original version of the project, which we are preserving until
    the bug reports for the native-JACK version slow down to a trickle.

PortMIDI: Seq64portmidi/seq64portmidi

    Builds and runs via the portmidi library in a Linux distro.  Has issues
    and is deprecated.
