The sequencer64 project is a continuation of sequencer24 to refactor it to
be tighter and easier to transition to to GTKmm 3, and much more.
Currently, it is basically equivalent to that project in functionality,
but the code is already significantly refactored.

The code has been broken up into libraries.  The next step
is to better separate the GUI support from the MIDI and LASH support.

In the meantime, we experimented with using std::multimap instead of
std::list as an event-container.  It works well, and loads MIDI files a
lot faster when compiled for debugging.  See the USE_EVENT_MAP macro
in the libseq64/include/event_list.hpp module.

Other major updates:

    -   The "user" configuration file is now written, as well as being read.
        It will also contain more extensive run-time configuration for the
        user-interface.
    -   The user-interface classes are being refactored to be derived from
        base classes providing common code.
    -   Constant variables are slowly being assigned to new members, in
        preparation for support of altering the number of sequences and sets
        supported.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description on installation.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that sequencer64 is pretty well documented by the following
project, which provides a 60-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
