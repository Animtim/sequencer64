README for Sequencer64 0.94.0 (Native JACK, CLI, multiple sets, varisets, tempo)

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24.  It extends seq24 in features and bug fixes;
the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the screenshot.  It is an old friend,
and maintains some backward-compatibility with the --legacy option.  See
https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git.  For prebuilt Debian
packages, see https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages.git.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Sequencer64 now has native JACK MIDI support, with virtual/manual ports
    and auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The JACK version without a GUI.  Currently controlled only via MIDI
    control events (start and stop events must be set up), it relies on a good
    working configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  Currently
    the only way to load a MIDI file is as the last argument on the command
    line.  We hope to add an OSC harness and command application eventually.
    Supports a "daemonize" option and dumping status to a log-file in the
    user-configuration directory.

With the big version jump from 0.9 to 0.90, the install process has changed.
See the INSTALL file.

    -   Version 0.94.0:
        -   Additions from the Oli Kester project, "Kepler34".
            -   Panic-button to stop everything!
            -   Recent-files menu entries; logs full path-names, but shows
                only the base name.  Has Gtk issue with using underscore as an
                accelerator.
            -   Support for box-selection/multiple-trigger-selection in Song
                editor.
    -   Version 0.93.5:
        -   Fixes an issue where incoming Active Sensing events are treated
            incorrectly.  Also update handling for similar events.
        -   Added configure and helper files to the official checkout so that
            users do not have to install so much dev software.
        -   Changed "-v" to be a new "--verbose" option for trouble-shooting.
        -   Fixed the setting of the "stazed" filter-by-channel functionality,
            which was disabled.
        -   Added (WE HOPE) the missing start/stop/continue functionality in
            the "rtmidi" ALSA and JACK implementations.
        -   Some improvements to set_status() functions.
        -   Minor cleanup, and investigation into an issue with triggers and
            the pause functionality in Song mode.
    -   Version 0.93.4:
        -   Duh, I forgot to do this.  Debian packaging fixes?
        -   Merging a miniature version of the PortMIDI library, called
            "portmini", into the code base ("windows" branch).
        -   Building for Windows, still in progress in the "windows" branch.
            Currently supports only the command-line build (bootstrap option
            -win).
    -   Version 0.93.3:
        -   Fixes to issue #105 relating to fruity interactions.
        -   Made it obvious when a nute-group cannot be supported due to
            larger set sizes with the --option sets=RxC setting.
        -   Desktop-settings updates.
        -   Other fixes to unreported problems we found.
    -   Version 0.93.2:
        -   Tweaking the sizing of main window to avoid bottom clipping found
            with some Gnome themes.  Just fudging it, unfortunately.
        -   Fixed issue #103 which wrote global tempo bytes backwards.
        -   Fixed issue #106, an off-by-one error in calculating measures that
            causes edited patterns to grow.
    -   Version 0.93.1:
        -   Version 0.93.1 supports the management of a native MIDI tempo
            track, adhering to MIDI specs.
        -   Tempo events are mostly editable like normal events.  No separate
            "tempo track" editor needed at present.
    -   Version 0.93.0:
        -   Initial support for the tempo track.  It currently includes making
            Meta events have full support in Sequencer64, including in the
            event editor (only Set Tempo and Time Signature are fully
            supported at this time, and share code with SysEx support).
        -   Merged pull request #95 of user layk to fix an issue with
            manipulating long notes while playing.
        -   Fixes a bug where the event editor is not updating properly.
            A long-time regression!
    -   Version 0.92.0:
        -   Added support for variable set-size, from the default
            4x8 (rows x columns) to 8x12.  Can be combined with multi-wid.
        -   Up to 96 hot-keys via a shift/double-shift feature.
    -   Version 0.91.0:
        -   Added option to show a grid of sets, with one set spinner per
            main window.  Set from command-line or the "usr" configuration.
    -   For more version information, see the NEWS file.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  It is fairly well
organized, fairly well documented, and less mysterious (to us, anyway) than
before.  Please see the INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.  Also see
contrib/notes/bugs_to_investigate.  Sequencer64 is well-documented by the
following project, which provides a 180+-page PDF file and its LaTeX source
code:

Legacy Sequencer64: Sequencer64/sequencer64

    This is the original (ALSA) version of the project, which we are
    preserving until the bug reports for the native-JACK version slow down to
    a trickle.

PortMIDI: Seq64portmidi/seq64portmidi

    Builds and runs via the portmidi library in a Linux distro.  Has issues
    and is deprecated for Linux, but might be used in the upcoming Windows
    implementation.
