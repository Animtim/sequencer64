The sequencer64 project is a continuation of sequencer24 to refactor it to
be tighter and easier to transition to to GTKmm 3, and much more.
Currently, it is basically equivalent to that project in functionality,
but the code is already significantly refactored.

The code has been broken up into libraries, for better separation between
GUI support and the files, MIDI, JACK, and LASH support.
Other major updates:

    -   Sequencer64 now uses std::multimap instead of std::list as an
        event-container.  It works well, and loads MIDI files a lot faster,
        especially when compiled for debugging.  The reason seems to be that
        sorting is a lot faster in the multimap. See the USE_EVENT_MAP macro
        in the libseq64/include/event_list.hpp module for selection of the
        container, and try it for yourself!
    -   The "user" configuration file is now written, as well as being read.
        It will eventually contain more extensive run-time configuration for
        the user-interface.
    -   The user-interface classes have refactored to be derived from
        base classes providing common code.
    -   Constant variables are slowly being assigned to new members, in
        preparation for support of altering the number of sequences and sets
        supported.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that sequencer64 is reasonably well documented by the following
project, which provides a 60-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
