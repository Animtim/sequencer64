Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24, extending it with many new features.
The heart of seq24 remains intact.  It is an old friend with a whole lot
of added equipment.  It has an extensive manual and prebuilt Debian packages,
source tarballs, and Windows installers:

Sequencer64 has builds for ALSA, PortMidi, JACK, Gtkmm 2.4, Qt 5, Windows,
command-line and a daemon.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Seq64 has native JACK MIDI/Transport, with virtual/manual ports and
    auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less application: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The RtMidi/JACK version without a GUI.  Controlled via MIDI control events
    (start/stop events must be set up), it relies on a good working
    configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  MIDI files are
    loaded via play-lists (see data/nanomap.rc and data/seq64cli.rc).  Seq64cli
    supports a "daemonize" option and log-files.

Windows support derived from PortMidi: Seq64qt5/qpseq64.exe

    Qpseq64 uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34 and the Sequencer64
    PortMidi engine.  Windows built-in MIDI devices are detected, inaccessible
    devices are ignored, and playback (e.g. to the built-in Windows wavetable
    synthesizer) work. It is built easily via Qt Creator or qmake, using the
    MingW support of Qt.  The Qt 5 GUI is still a little behind the Gtkmm 2.4
    GUI, but will eventually be the main GUI of Seq64.  Some configuration can
    be done manually in the "rc" and "usr" files.  See README.windows for more
    information, as it can be tricky to get the Windows configuration right.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions or using a
conventional source tarball.

This package is oriented to developers and users who do not mind building from
source, with a little help.  It is organized and well documented.
Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015, when I was laid
up after some old-man surgery :-(.
