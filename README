README for Sequencer64 0.9.10.0 (current branch = "fixups ongoing")
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-09-10 to 2016-02-21 (initial work started in July of 2015)

The sequencer64 project is a continuation of sequencer24 to refactor it to be
tighter and easier to transition to GTKmm 3, and much more.  By now, it is
well beyond the sequencer24 project (and seq24), in functionality, and the
code is already *significantly* refactored, although the heart of it remains
intact.

See the screenshot in the project root for some idea of what has changed
visually.  It is an old friend with some user-interface lipstick and a lot of
internal fixups.  And it still maintains backward-compatibility with seq24,
with the --legacy option.

Major updates:

    -   Sequencer64 loads SMF 0 files and splits the channels into separate
        tracks/sequences.
    -   JACK support has been improved.  Sequencer64 will track JACK transport
        properly, and as Master, will provide the proper Bar:Beats:Ticks (BBT)
        to other JACK clients.  We are still investigating JackBBTFrameOffset
        support.
    -   Long sequences now auto-scroll to keep up iwth the progress bar in the
        sequence/pattern editor.
    -   Highlighting of last sequence brought up for editing.
    -   Configurable progress bar and redraw timeouts.
    -   MIDI Clock support has been fixed.  Sequencer64 will now interact
        well with QJackCtl, Hydrogen, and Klick (command-line metronome).
        See the testing described in contrib/notes/jack-testing.txt.
    -   An event-editing window has been added, for viewing and editing a
        list of events, regardless of event type.  Still in progress; viewing
        is fine, editing basics work.
    -   Two synchronized song-editor windows can now be shown on screen, to
        better arrange songs with a large number of tracks.
    -   Added a more modern-looking, bolder font to the graphical user
        interface, selectable at run-time, in the "user" configuration file.
    -   Added a --bus option for easier testing against a specific
        hardware/software synthesizer.
    -   Added a --ppqn option to try to play files at the right speed.  Still
        in progress, as the Seq24 PPQN value of 192 affects a lot of code!
        It basically seems to work, but bugs may still lurk.
    -   Added support for using the Mod4/Super/Windows key to keep the
        performance and sequence user-interfaces in editing mode, very helpful
        for certain crappy laptop trackpads.  Extra "paint" key support also
        gets around the limitations of some trackpads.
    -   Added arrow key support to some of the windows and panes.
        -   Also supplemented the mouse with "p" to start paint/draw mode, and
            "x" to escape it, in the sequence and song editors.
        -   The "l" and "r" keys allow arrow movement of the performance
            markers, with "x" to escape this mode.
        -   If notes are selected in the sequence editor, the arrow keys can
            be used to move the notes in time and in pitch.  In the
            performance editor, a pattern can be selected with the mouse and
            moved right/left with the arrow keys.
    -   Tweaked the colors of some user-interface elements to make it
        easier to see them when combined.  For example, the background
        sequence is now colored, and the scale bars are now light grey.
        Progress bars are now red, if not running in legacy mode.
    -   The "rc" configuration file has been upgraded to support a couple
        more options, including the enabling/disabling of LASH session
        support.
    -   The "user" configuration file is now written, as well as being read.
        It will eventually contain more extensive run-time configuration for
        the user-interface.  The following items have been added so far,
        though they are not yet dispersed to all areas of the application
        and do not yet affect the appearance of the GUI:
        -   [user-interface-setting]
            -   Style of the main-window grid is now modifiable.
            -   Main window rows
            -   Main window columns
            -   Main window border thickness
            -   Main window spacing
            -   Maximum sets
            -   Control height
            -   Allowing two performance editors onscreen
            -   The page settings of scrollbar to increase the amount of
                scrolling from the too-short defaults.
        -   [user-midi-settings]
            -   Global PPQN value
            -   Global beats per bar
            -   Global beats per minute
            -   Global beat width
            -   Global MIDI buss override
    -   Internal (invisible) work:
        -   The code has been broken up into libraries, for better separation
            between GUI support and the files, MIDI, JACK, and LASH support.
        -   A wide range of MIDI files have been tested, to find bugs that
            can crash the application.  A nice increase in robustness.
        -   Centralized dirtiness-handling to the perform module, and
            improving its accuracy and comprehensiveness, still in progress,
            but much progress made.
        -   Set Tempo and Time Signature events are now read from
            non-Sequencer64 MIDI files.
        -   The user-interface classes have refactored to derive from
            base classes providing common code.
        -   Sequencer64 now uses std::multimap instead of std::list as an
            event-container.  It works well, and loads MIDI files a lot
            faster, especially when compiled for debugging.  The reason seems
            to be that sorting is a lot faster in the multimap. See the
            SEQ64_USE_EVENT_MAP macro in the libseq64/include/event_list.hpp
            module for selection of the container, and try it for yourself!
        -   Constant variables are slowly being assigned to new members, in
            preparation for support of altering the number of sequences and
            screen sets supported.

The list of minor issues we have found while exploring with Sequencer64 has
gotten fairly long, so we will concentrate on tightening up the application
behavior as much as possible.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  It is fairly well
organized, fairly well documented, and less mysterious (to us, anyway)
than before.  Please see the INSTALL file for a brief description of
installation.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.
Also see contrib/bugs_to_investigate.

Note that sequencer64 is reasonably well documented by the following
project, which provides a 100+-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
