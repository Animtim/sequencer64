The sequencer64 project is a continuation of sequencer24 to refactor it to
be tighter and easier to transition to to GTKmm 3, and much more.
Currently, it is basically equivalent to that project in functionality,
but the code is already significantly refactored.

See the screenshot in the project root for some idea of what has changed.

The code has been broken up into libraries, for better separation between
GUI support and the files, MIDI, JACK, and LASH support.
Other major updates:

    -   Sequencer64 now uses std::multimap instead of std::list as an
        event-container.  It works well, and loads MIDI files a lot faster,
        especially when compiled for debugging.  The reason seems to be that
        sorting is a lot faster in the multimap. See the USE_EVENT_MAP macro
        in the libseq64/include/event_list.hpp module for selection of the
        container, and try it for yourself!
    -   The "user" configuration file is now written, as well as being read.
        It will eventually contain more extensive run-time configuration for
        the user-interface.
    -   The user-interface classes have refactored to be derived from
        base classes providing common code.
    -   Constant variables are slowly being assigned to new members, in
        preparation for support of altering the number of sequences and sets
        supported.
    -   Added a more modern-looking, easier to read font to the graphical user
        interface.
    -   Tweaked the colors of some user-interface elements to make it
        easier to see them when combined.  For example, the background
        sequence is now colored, and the scale bars are now light grey.
    -   Added a --bus option for easier testing against a specific
        hardware/software synthesizer.
    -   Added a --ppqn option to try to play files at the right speed.  Still
        in progressm the Seq24 PPQN value of 192 affects a lot of code!
    -   Added support for using the Mod4/Super/Windows key to keep the
        performance and sequence user-interfaces in editing mode, very helpful
        for certain crappy laptop trackpads.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that sequencer64 is still reasonably well documented by the following
project, which provides a 60-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
