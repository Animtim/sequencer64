2015-09-10 to 2019-04-27

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24, extending it with many new features.
The heart of seq24 remains intact.  It is an old friend with a whole lot
of added equipment.  It has an extensive manual and prebuilt Debian packages,
source tarballs, and Windows installers:

Sequencer64 has builds for ALSA, PortMidi, JACK, Gtkmm 2.4, Qt 5, Windows,
and the command-line/daemon.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Seq64 has native JACK MIDI/Transport, with virtual/manual ports and
    auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less application: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The RtMidi/JACK version without a GUI.  Controlled via MIDI control events
    (start/stop events must be set up), it relies on a good working
    configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  MIDI files are
    loaded via play-lists (see data/nanomap.rc and data/seq64cli.rc).  Seq64cli
    supports a "daemonize" option and log-files.

Windows support derived from PortMidi: Seq64qt5/qpseq64.exe

    Qpseq64 uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34 and the Sequencer64
    PortMidi engine.  Windows built-in MIDI devices are detected, inaccessible
    devices are ignored, and playback (e.g. to the Windows wavetable
    synthesizer) work. It is built easily via Qt Creator or qmake, using
    MingW.  The Qt 5 GUI still has a few features to be added, but will
    eventually be the official GUI of Seq64.  See README.windows for more
    information.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions for Linux or Window,
and using a conventional source tarball.

This package is oriented to developers and users who do not mind building from
source, with a little help.  It is organized and well documented.
Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015, when I was laid
up after some old-man surgery :-(.
