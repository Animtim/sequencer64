The sequencer64 project is a continuation of sequencer24 to refactor it to
be tighter and easier to transition to to GTKmm 3, and much more.
Currently, it is basically equivalent to that project.

The code has been broken up into libraries.  The next step
is to better separate the GUI support from the MIDI and LASH support.

In the meantime, we experimented with using std::multimap instead of
std::list as an event-container.  It works well, and loads MIDI files a
lot faster when compiled for debugging.  See the USE_EVENT_MAP macro
in the libseq64/include/event_list.hpp module.

This package is currently oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description on installation.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that sequencer24 is pretty well documented by the following
project, which provides a 60-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
